<p class="caption2"><a name="SCICHI" id="SCICHI">VARIATION AND HEREDITY IN MAN.
(Abstract.)</a></p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Professor G. Sergi</span>,
<i>Professor of Anthropology, Rome</i>.</p>


<p>In his paper Professor G. Sergi wishes to show that in man after his
morphological characteristics are established there occur no profound
variations to change the typical forms which are naturally persistent.</p>

<p>The principal discussion concerns the different forms of the skull which
are important as characteristics of race. Professor Sergi distinguishes in
the human skull two principal and primordial forms: the dolichomorphic
and the brachymorphic are both very ancient, as they are found contemporaneously
in European human fossils. Consequently he attacks the idea of
the transformation of one form into another. He does not find it
demonstrated that the <a id="dolichomorphic"></a>dolichomorphic type is transformed into the brachymorphic,
and considers the causes adduced for this supposed transformation
insufficient. It is neither the effect of environment of the plains or of the
mountains, or the climatic influence of extreme cold, or the increase of
volume of the brain supposed to be due to greater cerebral activity owing to
a more developed culture, that the form of the skull is transformed into
another type. All these suppositions are contrary to facts, because dolichomorphic
and brachymorphic skulls are found alike in mountain and plain,
in northern and southern regions, among primitive and civilized populations,
in fact without any distinction.</p>

<p>The mutations that are believed to be found in the different populations
are due to the effect of intermixture and penetration of new demographical
elements, and not to the transformation of forms. That is also proved by the
crossing of the two different human types from which no intermediary forms
are derived: but instead there occurs in the heredity a segregation analagous
to that under the Mendelian theory. If this were not so, to-day after
many thousands of years of intermixture of the most diverse races, there
would be but a single form derived from transformation; the demonstration
of the facts proves that this has not occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a great persistence in human physical forms, the variability is
minimum after the formation of the races, and does not effect the changes
of type.</p>

<p>The same fact can be noticed for the external characteristics of man,
such as the colour of the skin, the colour and form of the hair, and the
colour of the iris. It is solely in the crossings that there can be intermediary
formations which have not indefinite heredity, because the segregation of
characteristics takes place also in this case.</p>

<p>But the studies and observations on this matter are still incomplete,
especially according to the Mendelian theory, and there is need of new
and careful observation.</p>

<p>As to the pathological inheritance, there exist facts that confirm it in a
general way, but the laws under which this heredity occurs have not been
fully verified.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCICHII" id="SCICHII">ON THE INCREASE OF STATURE IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN
POPULATIONS.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption2">By <span class="smcap">Soren Hansen</span>, M.D.,<br />
<i>Director of the Danish Anthropological Survey, Copenhagen.</i></p>


<p>The improvement in stature in many European countries during the past
50 years is generally ascribed simply to improved hygienic and economic
conditions, but the question is really very intricate. The presence of different
racial elements, social selection with its tendency to draw the well-made
into towns, and the falling death-rate, etc., complicate the investigations.
In all countries there is a great lack of truly comparable data from
earlier years. The British Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical
Deterioration, for example, though it collected an enormous amount of
material, was unsuccessful in its endeavours to solve the main question.
Single cases, e.g., the comparison of factory children with the boys of
the York Quaker school (Anthropometric Committee, Brit. Ass. 1883), are
certainly of great interest, but how can such cases be taken to represent the
average?</p>

<p>Other countries possess a rich source of information in their conscription
lists. Thus, in Denmark these lists show an unmistakable increase of
3.7 cm. (1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch) in the average height of the adult Dane during the past
50-60 years. Similar increases are noted from Norway, Sweden and
Holland. This increase suggests that there may have been more or less
periodic waves of increase and decrease in height, since, on the one hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
we cannot imagine such an increase continuing indefinitely, and on the
other, we know that the men of, say, 1000 years ago were quite as tall as
they are at present. What are the agencies alternately improving or impairing
the racial qualities? First of all, have we sufficiently exact, numerical
information regarding the racial qualities?</p>

<p>A critical examination of all available data is very necessary. For
example, the weight of new-born children is stated to have increased in
England by 59 and 82 grams during the past 20 years, and in Denmark
we can point to an increase of 40 grams in 35 years. But when we consider
all the possible sources of error, it must be admitted that these statements,
and especially the former, require confirmation. The material is not
homogenous. Again, it is stated, that the average height of adult women
in France has increased by 3 cm. in the last 80 years&mdash;but when we read
that the total number of measurements in the last period was only 255, we
cannot rely very much upon this statement.</p>

<p>On the whole, it may be said, that we have a few cases of definite increase
and a goodly number very doubtful. We really need to have the first of the
principal recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical
Deterioration carried out in all countries, for, the more we subject the
available data to critical scrutiny, the more we see the hopelessness of attaining
to any real and fruitful conclusions, unless we have an efficient organisation
of capable workers, backed by governmental as well as private support.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCICHIII" id="SCICHIII">THE SO-CALLED LAWS OF INHERITANCE IN MAN.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Professor V. Guiffrida-Ruggeri</span>,<br />
<i>Professor of Anthropology, Naples.</i></p>


<p>The Mendelian laws find verification in man. Every race, whether a
sub-species or a variety, has an hereditary possession of certain characters;
a possession which is completely transmitted to the descendants, in whom is
preserved the same germ plasm as in the progenitors.</p>

<p>The researches of C. B. and G. Davenport seem to have proved the recessive
character of albinism and its obedience to the Mendelian law. Hurst
has presented figures which show that the inheritance of colour in the iris
of the human eye obeys Mendelian laws. Davenport has established the
order of dominance by the form of hair, which also obeys the Mendelian
law.</p>

<p>De Quatrefages, many years before the re-affirmation of Mendel's discoveries,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

where the new being is organised. Now, this contest does not take
place <i>en bloc</i>, so to speak, as has been generally admitted. Each of
the characters of the two parents struggles on its own account against
the corresponding character (its antagonist, as has just been said).
When the hereditary energy is equal on both sides there necessarily
ensues a kind of process of which the consequence is the fusion of the
maternal and paternal characters in an intermediate character. If the
energies are very unequal the hybrid inherits a character borrowed
entirely from one of his parents; but this parent, conqueror on one
point, may be conquered upon another. Hence, there results with the
hybrid a <i>juxtaposition</i> of characters derived from each of the types of
which he is the child."</p>

<p>Above all, I have wished to call attention to the so-called laws of dominance,
because of their great importance. We may conclude that in the case
of man the dominant characters are also the original ones.</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<i>Biologist, Maine Agricultural Experiment Station.</i></p>


<p>The purpose of this paper is to give an account (necessarily abbreviated,
and without presentation of complete evidence) of the results of an
investigation into the mode of inheritance of fecundity in the domestic fowl,
and to point out some of the possible eugenic bearings of these results.</p>

<p>It is shown that while the continued selection, over a period of years,
of highly fecund females failed to bring about any change in average
fecundity of the strain used, this character must nevertheless be inherited
since pedigree lines have been isolated which uniformly breed true to definite
degrees of fecundity.</p>

<p>It is further shown that observed variations in actually realized fecundity
(number of eggs laid) do not depend upon anatomical differences in respect
to the number of visible oöcytes in the ovary. The differential factor on
which the variations in fecundity depend must be primarily physiological.</p>

<p>Fecundity in the fowl is shown to be inherited in strict accord with the
following Mendelian plan:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Observed individual variations in fecundity depend essentially upon
two separately inherited physiological factors (designated L<sub>1</sub>, and L<sub>2</sub>).</p>

<p>2. <i>High</i> fecundity is manifested only when both of these factors are
present together in the same individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Either of these factors when present alone, whether in homozygous or
heterozygous form, causes about the same degree of <i>low</i> fecundity to be
manifested.</p>

<p>4. One of these factors, namely L<sub>2</sub>, is sex-limited or sex-correlated in
its inheritance, in such way that in gametogenesis any gamete which bears
the female sex-determinant F does not bear L<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>5. There is a definite and clear-cut segregation of high fecundity from
low fecundity, in the manner set forth above.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of eugenics it is pointed out that these results
furnish a new conception of the mode of inheritance of fecundity, and may
be helpful in suggesting a method of attacking the same problem for man.</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Prof. Enrico Morselli</span>,<br />
<i>Director of the Clinic for Mental and Nervous Diseases, Genoa University</i>.</p>


<p>All natural varieties or races of mankind differ, not only by their
physical, but also by their mental, characters. There exists, therefore,
an "Ethnic Psychology" which, along with "Ethnic Somatology,"
constitutes the complete Science of Anthropology or the Natural History of
Man. This must describe and classify races and populations under a
double aspect&mdash;physical and psychical.</p>

<p>The psychical characters of races are in part <i>original</i>, and in part
acquired through <i>adaptation</i>. These persist in a race as long as such
mesological adaptation lasts; they vary with modifications of the conditions
of life, including social activities and inter-racial relations.</p>

<p>In mixed unions, amongst different races, there are always some which
are more vigorous, biologically and mentally, more fully developed, which
impress their characters upon their descendants. For the vitality and
well-being of mixed or metamorphic populations a certain amount of
difference amongst the parent races is necessary, but too great a difference
is injurious to the offspring.</p>

<p>The offspring of mixed unions present in their psychology a
<i>mixture</i>, again a <i>combination</i> or fusion of the mental characters of the
parent races: sometimes certain psychical characters of a race become the
<i>dominant</i> characters.</p>

<p>All ethnic groupings have their destiny marked out by the grade attained
in <i>the human psycho-physical hierarchy</i>. Nevertheless, it is necessary that
each race or nation, when it knows its contribution to the development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
universal civilisation, should contemplate the preservation of its own ethnic
type. Differentiation amongst peoples is an indispensable factor in human
progress.</p>

<p>The science of eugenics should not look for the realisation of a uniform
type of man, but vary its aims and methods according to the natural
differentiation of races and nations, taking account of ethnic psychology
equally with ethnic somatology.</p>

<p>The humanity of the future will be physically and mentally superior
to the existing humanity, but the <i>amelioration of the species</i> ought not to aim
at the equality of races and populations. These races and populations
ought not to lose their acquisition of particular adaptations to different
conditions of existence.</p>

<p>A science of universal or common eugenics should allow a eugenic
ethnology to exist, which should indicate and facilitate for each race or
nation the defence and propagation of its own <i>physical type</i> and its own
<i>mentality</i>. The most vigorous and dominant races will always be those
which know how to create and preserve in sexual unions their characteristics
of structure and culture.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCICHVI" id="SCICHVI">THE INHERITANCE OF EPILEPSY.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">David Fairchild Weeks</span>, M.D.,<br />
<i>Medical Superintendent and Executive Officer, the New Jersey State
Village for Epileptics at Skillman, U.S.A.</i></p>


<p>In this paper the writer has endeavoured to learn what laws, if any,
epilepsy follows in its return to successive generations, and the relation it
bears to alcoholism, migraine, paralysis, and other symptoms of lack of
neural strength.</p>

<p>The data used in the study was analysed according to the Mendelian
method which assumes that the inheritance of any character is not from
the parents, grandparents, etc., but from the germ plasm out of which every
fraternity and its parents and other relatives have arisen. If the soma
possesses the trait of the recessive to normality sort, it lacks in its germ
plasm the determiner upon which the normal development depends, and this
condition is called nulliplex. If the soma possesses the trait of the
dominant to normality sort, the determiner was derived from both parents
and is double in the germ plasm, or normal, all of the germ cells have the
determiner; or else it came from one parent only, is single in the germ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
plasm, or simplex, and half of the germ cells have and half lack the
determiner.</p>

<p>The method of obtaining the data was by means of field workers, who
interviewed in their homes the parents, relatives and all others interested
in the epileptic patient. These visits have established a friendly feeling
toward and an intelligent understanding of the Institution and its work.</p>

<p>The study is based on the data derived from 397 histories, covering 440
matings.</p>

<p>The matings are classified under the six possible types, of nulliplex ×
nulliplex, nulliplex × simplex, nulliplex × normal, simplex × simplex,
simplex × normal, and normal × normal.</p>

<p>Under the first type all those matings where both parents were epileptic,
one was epileptic and the other feeble-minded, or both were feeble-minded,
are classified. According to Mendel's Law, all of the children should be
nulliplex. The data showed all of the children defective.</p>

<p>Under the type nulliplex × simplex, all matings where one parent was
epileptic or feeble-minded and the other "tainted," that is, alcoholic,
neurotic, migrainous, or showed some mental weakness, are classified. From
this type of mating, 50% of the offspring are expected to be nulliplex and
50% simplex. From the matings where one parent was epileptic or feeble-minded
and the other alcoholic, there were 61% mentally deficient or
nulliplex, the remainder simplex. The figures for the offspring from the
other matings showed 47% nulliplex, and 53% simplex.</p>

<p>For the third type, nulliplex by normal, all those matings where one
parent was epileptic or feeble-minded and the other reported as mentally
normal are classified. From this type of mating, the expectations are that
all of the children would be simplex. A study of the ancestors of the
normal parents showed these parents simplex rather than normal. The
analysis of the offspring showed at least 43% nulliplex, which is a close
fitting to the type of mating nulliplex × simplex.</p>

<p>The fourth type of mating is simplex × simplex. Here, all matings
where both of the parents were "tainted" are classified. The expectation
is that 25% of the offspring would be nulliplex, in reality 35% were found
to be mentally deficient.</p>

<p>Simplex × normal is the fifth type of mating considered. The matings
where one parent was tainted and the other supposedly normal, are classified
here. From a study of their ancestors these normal parents appeared to be
simplex, and the classification of the offspring showed more than 25%
nulliplex, which is the expectation from simplex × simplex mating.</p>

<p>The sixth type is normal × normal, and the matings where both parents
were reported normal is studied under this heading. Here, as before, a
study of the ancestors of these normal parents indicates that they are
simplex, and not normal. The classification of the children showed a close
fitting to the expectation from a simplex × simplex mating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>A special study of the matings where one or both of the parents was
migrainous or alcoholic, shows a close relationship between these conditions
and epilepsy.</p>

<p>The following conclusions are drawn from the study.</p>

<p>The common types of epileptics lack some element necessary for
complete mental development. This is also true of the feeble-minded.</p>

<p>Two epileptic parents produce only defectives. When both parents are
either epileptic or feeble-minded their offspring are also mentally defective.</p>

<p>Epilepsy tends in successive generations to form a larger part of the
population.</p>

<p>The normal parents of epileptics are not normal but simplex, and have
descended from tainted ancestors.</p>

<p>Alcohol may be a cause of defect in that more children of alcoholic
parents are defective than where alcoholism is not a factor.</p>

<p>Neurotic and other tainted conditions are closely allied with epilepsy.</p>

<p>In the light of present knowledge, epilepsy, considered by itself, is not a
Mendelian factor, but epilepsy and feeble-mindedness are Mendelian factors
of the recessive type.</p>

<p>Tainted individuals, as neurotics, alcoholics, criminals, sex offenders,
etc., are simplex and normals or simplex and normal in character.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCICHVII" id="SCICHVII">THE INFLUENCE OF THE AGE OF PARENTS ON THE
PSYCHO-PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE OFFSPRING.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Antonio Marro</span>,<br />
<i>Director of the Lunatic Asylum, Turin.</i></p>


<p>The natural law of heredity holds good whether for the physical characteristics
or for those which are biological and moral.</p>

<p>The apparent anomalies which children present in not reproducing the
qualities of the parents, and the unlikeness frequently noted among the
children of the same family, only serve to reveal the presence of the particular
conditions of the parents at the time of begetting which has influenced
the offspring.</p>

<p>We have a proof of this law in the anomalies presented by the children
of parents who, at the time of begetting, were themselves in anomalous conditions
by reason of intoxication or disease.</p>

<p>Among the conditions of parents which are capable of influencing the
characteristics of children must be included the changes which their organism
undergoes by reason of advancing age.</p>

<p>I propose to study the effects of age on the physical and moral characters
of the children. My researches have extended to numerous criminals and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
insane persons, as well as to scholars of the public schools and other normal
persons affected or not with special diseases.</p>

<p>Of my studies on criminals, the result is: that the children of young
parents are found in large numbers guilty of offences against property; and
this is natural. The first impulse to that is not due to wickedness, which
impels them to inflict harm on others, but to love of pleasure, of revel, of
idleness&mdash;all features of youth, during which period the passions are very
active, and no restraint present with which to repress and subjugate them.</p>

<p>Swindlers alone are exceptions to this rule, but swindling is a crime of
riper years, according to the dictum of Quetelet.</p>

<p>Among crimes of personal violence, I have found a numerical superiority
in the children of aged parents. Assassins, homicides, those who show the
completest absence of sentiments of affection and often delusions of persecution
more or less pronounced, gave a proportion of children of aged
parents far greater than that furnished by all the other categories of
delinquents; the proportion is as high for fathers as for mothers of advanced
age.</p>

<p>Here, too, we note a certain correlation between the state of discontent,
of suspicion, of frigid egoism, which the decline of physical energy tends
to arouse in the old, and the absence of affectionate sentiment and a tendency
to delusions of persecution which are usual in murderers. Among the
insane, moral idiocy in particular, and the degenerative forms in general,
appeared more frequently in children of aged parents.</p>

<p>As to schoolboys, I have noticed that the minimum of good conduct and
the maximum of better developed intelligence coincides with the possession
of youth by both parents.</p>

<p>The age of complete development corresponds to a maximum of good
conduct and a minimum of bad conduct, and retains a large proportion of
intelligent children.</p>

<p>In the period of decline of both parents, good conduct of children
is observed in a smaller proportion than in the preceding period, and high
intelligence in a very small proportion.</p>

<p>Among biological qualities I have made observations on longevity;
among persons of 70 and 80 whom I have examined there is a large proportion
of parents who themselves enjoyed remarkably long lives, which proves
the transmissibility from father to son of powers of resistance against the
stresses of life.</p>

<p>Among physical qualities I have made note of the fact that from
alcoholic or aged parents were descended children in whom degenerative
physical characteristics were most frequently apparent, recalling some features
of an inferior human type, such as exaggeration of the frontal sinuses, the
torus occipitalis, ears with the Darwinian tubercles prominent, the forehead
receding, etc. At the same time the ascendants of those who presented
typical and anomalous characters, due to morbid influences of various kinds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and following on faulty development of the f&#339;tus, such as cretinism, congenital
goître, nasal deflections, strabismus, plagio-cephaly, hydrocephaly,
dental malformation, etc., showed a large number of alcoholics and epileptics.</p>

<p>The explanation of the pernicious consequences to the psycho-physical
characters of the children of parents too young or too advanced in age
does not present much difficulty.</p>

<p>At the younger period the organism is still in process of formation;
the incomplete development of the skeleton, as of all the other organs, continually
absorbs a mass of plastic materials necessary to the formation of offspring.
So we may consider that the faults of children born of too young
parents are due to an incomplete development because of the insufficiency of
plastic material.</p>

<p>We must, on the other hand, seek in the conditions which accompany old
age for the reason why it has a disastrous influence on the vitality of the
germinal elements of the parents and predisposes the descendants to various
forms of physical and moral degeneracy.</p>

<p>During this period we have in the tissues, instead of a development and
renewal of protoplasm, the tendency to an accumulation of fat; and in the
whole organism, chiefly in the tissues of the arterial system, we find the
tendency to a deposit in their structure of an amorphous substance which
converts the supple elastic canals into rigid tubes; and from this a general
slowing up of the organic functions (circulation, oxidation, secretion) results;
the blood, not reaching the degree of elaboration which it possessed before,
acquires a greater acidity, and cannot by the ordinary excretory channels
so quickly get rid of the catabolic products with which it is charged.</p>

<p>By reason of these conditions the organism of older people undergoes a
sort of slow and gradual intoxication, which, at the same time as it shows
itself in the individual by the gradual languishing of all his functions,
influences in a disastrous manner the germs which develop within him, and
predisposes them to become beings condemned to degeneracy.</p>

<p>Consequently this cause of degeneracy enters the general category of
intoxications.</p>

<i>Professor of Biology, Cambridge</i>.</p>


<p>To the student of genetics, man, like any other animal, is material for
working out the manner in which characters, whether physical or mental,
are transmitted from one generation to the next. Viewed in this way he
must be regarded as unpromising, not only from the small size of his
families, the time consumed in their production, and the long period of
immaturity, but also because full experimental control is here out of the
question. For these reasons man is of interest to the student of genetics,
chiefly in so far as he presents problems in heredity which are rarely to
be found in other species, and can only be studied at present in man himself.
The aim of the Eugenist, on the other hand, is to control human
mating in order to obtain the largest proportion of individuals he considers
best fitted to the form of society which he affects. It is
evident that to do this effectually he must have precise knowledge of the
manner in which transmission of characters occurs, and more especially of
those with which he particularly wishes to deal. Precise knowledge is at
present available in man for relatively few characters; and those characters,
such as eye-colour, and certain somewhat rare deformities, are not the
kind on which the Eugenist lays great stress. The one instance of eugenic
importance that could be brought under immediate control is that of feeble-mindedness.
Speaking generally, the available evidence suggests that it is a
case of simple Mendelian inheritance. Occasional exceptions occur, but
there is every reason to expect that a policy of strict segregation would
rapidly bring about the elimination of this character.</p>

<p>There is reason to suppose that many human qualities are more complicated
in their transmission, and it is probable that certain phenomena now
being studied in plants and animals will throw definite light upon man.
Though characters are frequently transmitted on the Mendelian scheme quite
independently of one another, there are cases known in which they are linked
up more or less completely in the germ cells with the determinant of a particular
sex. Sex-limited inheritance of this nature has been carefully worked
out in particular cases in Lepidoptera and poultry. As yet there is much
to be learnt in this direction, and further progress may be expected to lead
eventually to a precise knowledge of the mode of transmission of many
human defects, such as colour-blindness and hæmophilia. It is not unlikely
that a similar mode of transmission will be found to hold good for
many human characters usually classed as normal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Another set of phenomena which will probably be found of importance
in the heredity of man are those included under the terms "coupling"
and "repulsion." Characters, each exhibiting simple Mendelian segregation,
may become linked together more or less completely in the process of
heredity, or the reverse may occur. Our knowledge of these phenomena
is at present almost completely confined to cases in plants, but evidence is
beginning to be obtained for their occurrence in animals. It is not unlikely
that they will be found to play a considerable part in human heredity. For
one of the most noticeable things about man is the frequency with which
children resemble one or other parent to the seemingly almost complete
exclusion of the other. In view of the mongrelisation of the human race,
the frequency of these cases is very remarkable, and can hardly fail to
suggest that some sort of coupling between characters plays a large part in
human heredity.</p>

<p>Except in very few cases, our knowledge of heredity in man is at present
far too slight and too uncertain to base legislation upon. On the
other hand, experience derived from plants and animals has shewn that
problems of considerable complexity can be unravelled by the experimental
method, and the characters concerned brought under control. Though the
direct method is hardly feasible in man, much may yet be learnt by collecting
accurate pedigrees and comparing them with standard cases worked out in
other animals. But it must be clearly recognised that the collection of such
pedigrees is an arduous undertaking demanding high critical ability, and
only to be carried out satisfactorily by those who have been trained in and
are alive to the trend of genetic research.</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Adolphe Pinard</span>,<br />
<i>Professor at the Faculty; Member of the Academy of Medicine of
Paris.</i></p>


<p>Sir Francis Galton has entitled Eugenics the new science having for its
object the study of the causes subject to social control which can improve or
impair the racial qualities of future generations, whether physical or mental.</p>

<p>Eugenics, thus defined, is nothing else but "Education before Procreation,"
which has been studied in France for a number of years, and
which constitutes the first part of child-culture, "a science having for its
object the search for information relative to the reproduction, preservation,
and improvement of the human species"(<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The Congress ought then to have for its object to work for the investigation
of the conditions necessary to secure a favourable procreation. Now,
it appears that the word "Eugenics," from the etymological point of view,
does not characterise either explicitly or sufficiently the proposed object,
while the word "Eugénique," of [Greek: gennaô], at once recalls to the
mind the idea of a favourable procreation(<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">
<span class="label">[2]</span></a> Besides, the word "Eugenics" recalls in France
a chemical term: eugenic-acid.</p></div>

<p>It is part of the duty of our first principal sitting to lay down a rule
upon this point.</p>

<p>Certainly, biological, sociological, and historical researches, laws and
social customs regarded in their relations with the science of Eugenics,
are necessary and will undoubtedly result in extremely interesting data, but
from now it is above all things urgent to establish and proclaim eugenic
principles.</p>

<p>Researches relating to physiological heredity and pathological heredity
ought to be pursued without interruption, but it is necessary to make known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as soon as possible to the masses of the people the individual conditions,
fully understood, which alone permit a favourable and healthy procreation.
In a word, it is necessary, by every means and as soon as possible, to
organise a great movement in order to show to the greatest number of human
beings the absolute necessity for a conscientious, <i>i.e.</i>, an enlightened procreation.
We must bravely approach the civilising of <i>the reproductive
instinct</i>, which alone has remained in a barbarous state amongst all the so-called
civilised nations from the earliest times.</p>

<p>Then only, when societies have fulfilled this duty, will they have the
right to investigate what they ought and can effect against those for whom
future offspring would be recognised as fatally disastrous.</p>

<p>Finally, it is fully understood that researches relating to selection in
the human species must be pursued in a parallel manner, as is now done
with such fruitful results for animals and vegetables in Genetics, and in
throwing light upon the constantly increasing conquests of this other science.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCIICHII" id="SCIICHII">PRACTICAL ORGANIZATION OF EUGENIC ACTION.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Dr. Louis Querton</span>,<br />
<i>Professor at the University of Brussels.</i></p>


<p>Now that many studies on the physiology and hygiene of reproduction
of man have been made, and many investigations on degeneration have
been conducted, we may face the problem of the betterment of the race,
from a practical standpoint.</p>

<p>If the eugenic action cannot yet strive directly against hereditary transmission
of anomalies, it can fight successfully against the causes of
degeneration which act during the development of the individual.</p>

<p>Physical and social environment influences these causes, which, on account
of their growing complexity, create more and more obstacles to the normal
evolution of the individual, while at the same time they force him to acquire
greater and more varied aptitudes.</p>

<p>To thwart the prejudicial action of the environment on the development
of the individual, the systematic organization of this development seems
to be of first importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The control of the development of the children, at the different phases
of their evolution, is strictly necessary to assure the education of the individual
and to check the degeneration of the race.</p>

<p>The control is already established for certain classes of children, and
during limited periods of their development. Nurslings, school children,
and labourers can already, sometimes compulsorily, be submitted to
control.</p>

<p>But the insufficiency of the actual organization is very evident, and the
results are, from the eugenic standpoint, unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In order to be really effective and to contribute to the improvement of
the individual and to the betterment of the race, the control of the development
should, as far as possible, be exerted over all children, and it should
last during the whole period of their evolution. This control should be
compulsory, as well as education; it should be exercised by an institution,
the frequentation of which, as well as that of school, might be forced upon
all children whose development is not submitted to an effective control in
their homes. Private initiative should create such institutions everywhere,
and thus prepare legislative interference.</p>

<p>These methodically organized eugenic institutions should, in the future,
be the development of the administrative institutions, which actually establish
the civil state of individuals. They would tend to facilitate the
education of individuals and public bodies; at the same time they would
assure the strict application of the laws concerning the protection and
education of childhood.</p>

<p>They would collect the documents necessary to the scientific knowledge of
the facts of heredity, and would supply precise information concerning the
effective work of different social institutions on transformation of the race.</p>

<p>Of the various laws limiting freedom of marriage three are of biological
import. First, the limitation of relationship between the mates; second,
the limitations in mental capacity of the mates; and third, limitations of
race.</p>

<p>For the first there is a biological justification in so far as cousin
marriages are apt to bring in from both sides of the house the same defect.
For the second the justification is partial; but there is equal reason for
forbidding the marriage of normal persons both of whom have mentally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
defective parents or other close relatives. The denial of marriage between
races has this justification, that most other races have not, through selection,
attained the social status of the Caucasian. In such cases the socially
inadequate should be sterilized or segregated in other races as well as in the
Caucasian.</p>

these, we must adjust them to principles generally admitted.</p>

<p>And inasmuch as it advocates practical rules and seeks to check the
propagation of the unfit, by isolation or sterilization (voluntary or enforced),
it is an artificial selection.</p>

<p>Its justification lies in the fact that, without intervention, the descendants
of defectives or degenerates would, in a few generations, eliminate themselves
by early death of children or by natural sterility. This would produce
a natural selection which Eugenics simply proposes to anticipate by
social economy.</p>

<p>It seems that, by applying Darwinian principles, the group of defectives,
considered at a given moment, could be rapidly extinguished. But this
group is continually reinforced by fresh degeneration of healthy stocks which
become tainted.</p>

<p>Hence the need to keep our eye on the re-formation of the group as well
as its elimination, and to keep in touch with Lamarckian principles. The
study of the origin and hereditary conservation of defects points already
as essential factors, to alcoholism, syphilis, and more generally every
chronic ailment and diathesis, among which gout must be put in a leading
position. Everything which will tend to restrain the action of these
factors is of capital importance from our present point of view, whether
it occurs in the ranks of rich or poor.</p>

<p>The questions, thus, which Eugenics seeks to answer would be on this
view reduced to questions of hygiene and morals.</p>

<p>So that the different biological principles, which sometimes seem in
mutual opposition, would become convergent, and would find in Eugenics
a ready reconciliation and a field of useful co-operation.</p>

<p>The new social consciousness is indicated; first, by the larger powers
and duties assumed by the State: second, by the new sense of social
solidarity affecting persons and groups of persons within the State. The
exclusion from parenthood of such wards of the State as the feeble-minded,
the insane, and the pauper has gone beyond debate; and for all that are
legally excluded from parenthood, custodial care is required. There is need
to develop a new ethical sense of the individual in regard to his own
relations to the social group. We have not yet sufficient facts to establish
a definite relation between physical fitness and social efficiency. This is
the place for caution.</p>

<p>Questions of maternity among the poor: (<i>a</i>) Hard labour must be
forbidden to the expectant mother; (<i>b</i>) she must have nourishing food; (<i>c</i>)
surroundings must be wholesome. The economic problem is solved in the
increased vitality and consequent earning power of the coming generation.</p>

<p>Problem of the parenthood of the better classes: just as important and
more difficult. The question is not only vital and economic; it is also
ethical.</p>

<p>The ignorance of parents and the defects of children. The State has
invaded the home, and has set standards, both physical and moral, for the
family. It is the duty of the State to secure the proper physical environment
for the home. It is a municipal problem. It is a problem of public
health. The whole movement looks to the triumph of a vital democracy,
which is more important than either political or industrial democracy.</p>

<p>Relations of alcoholism to neurasthenia, of tuberculosis to feeble-mindedness,
of bad social and labour conditions to both, indicate cross
sections in the problem. Vices of the rich in most countries are greater than
the vices of the poor. A vital democracy cannot be based upon physical
tests and material comfort. Its deepest foundations are psychical and
ethical.</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Professor Achille Loria</span>,<br />
<i>University of Turin.</i></p>


<p>Artificial selection could be perfectly applied to the human species, in
which case marriages would be arranged between persons better endowed,
physically and mentally, and the worse endowed would be excluded from
marriage. But this selection encounters the gravest practical difficulties;
because, if it is relatively easy to estimate the physical qualities of man,
nothing on the other hand is harder than to estimate his mental qualities. A
dynamometer of intelligence does not exist, and Galton's method of observing
the points of merit of University graduates is very insufficient and
fallible.</p>

<p>In face of these difficulties there naturally arises the idea of inferring
the psycho-physical aptitudes of individuals from their social and economic
position, or from their income, which is easily measured. In accord with
this idea, it would be a question of acting so that marriages would be effected
exclusively and predominantly amongst individuals provided with superior
incomes, and to prevent, as far as possible, marriages between persons of
inferior incomes, or of no income at all.</p>

<p>But all this would be plausible if there should be a real analogy between
the economic élite, and the psycho-physical élite, or if the former were
really a product of the latter. Now, this is precisely what I deny. The
<i>economic élite</i> is not in the least the product of the possession of superior
qualities, but is simply the result of a blind struggle between incomes, which
carries to the top those who, at the start, possess a larger income through
causes which may be absolutely independent of the possession of superior
endowments. (See my <i>Sintesi economica</i>&mdash;Paris, Giard et Briard, 1911.)
Hence, nothing makes it impossible that the wealthier people should be precisely
the worst endowed, physically and mentally, and this as a matter of
fact happens in innumerable cases.</p>

<p>Besides, we have an indirect proof of this in the very results of selective
processes as, until now, they are practised. And, in fact, conjugal selection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to-day takes place precisely amongst individuals of the same class, or belonging
to the same standard of income, so that persons of the upper classes
always marry exclusively amongst each other. So then these marriages,
which, according to the theory, ought to give more splendid results, give, on
the contrary, more wretched results. Galton's same law of "return to
the mean," or the fact that the descendants of persons of high class sometimes
have inferior endowments as compared with the average of the race,
could not be fulfilled if persons of the upper classes who marry with each
other were really select persons, physically and mentally.</p>

<p>There would also be in this case a falling off from the super-normal
qualities of an exceptionally gifted parent, but in that case the characters of
the children would always be superior to those of the descendants of the
lower classes. If this does not happen, if the children of the upper classes
show qualities inferior to those of the average of children of the lower
classes, this proves conclusively that married people of the superior classes
were not in the least endowed with specially high aptitudes, but, on the
contrary, presented the opposite characteristics. Thus, the same law of
Galton, properly interpreted, shows the absolute independence of largeness of
income and excellence of individual qualities, hence the absurdity and danger
of Eugenics upon an economic foundation, such as many desire.</p>

<p>The researches of Fahlbeck upon the Swedish nobility, which show
the rapid extinction of the upper classes who practise <i>Economic Eugenics</i>,
is a further proof of the absence of any link between economic superiority
and psycho-physical superiority; since if the wealthier people, who usually
intermarry, were really the better endowed, their descendants would never
show those phenomena of extinction which betray a leaven of inner
degeneration.</p>

<p>I conclude that Economic Eugenics is already practised to-day upon a
large scale, and hence it is already possible to form an accurate judgment
upon its results&mdash;which are those of return to the mean&mdash;degeneration and
extinction of race. Now, these same results show that the economically
superior classes are not at all the best endowed, and often even degenerate,
and that, therefore, the only method calculated to effect a conjugal selection
which would be socially useful is not to unite in marriage the richer people,
but individuals really possessing superior qualities, and to exclude from marriage
those who do not possess them.</p>

MENTAL CHARACTERS IN THE LOWER SOCIAL CLASSES.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Professor Alfredo Niceforo</span>,<br />
<i>Of the University of Naples.</i></p>


<p>The author has compared the physical, demographic, and mental characters
of the upper and leisured classes with the same characters in
individuals of the inferior and poor classes. He has made use of several
methods: (1) A comparison between the well-to-do and the poor children in
schools; (2) a comparison between individuals belonging to different professions;
(3) a comparison between the rich and the poor quarters of the same city.</p>

<p>He has also studied 4,000 children of the schools of Lausanne; Italian
peasants; conscripts of different countries, classified according to their
occupation; and the rich and the poor quarters of Lausanne, Paris, etc.</p>

<p>He has found that individuals of the lower classes show a smaller
development of stature, of cranial capacity, of sensibility, of resistance to
mental fatigue, a delay in the period when puberty makes its appearance,
a slackening in growth, a very large number of anomalies, etc.</p>

<p>The causes of these differences ascertained in comparing the two groups
are of the <i>mesological</i> and <i>individual order</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i>mesological</i> order because the conditions of life where men of the
lower classes are forced to live constitute one of the causes of the deterioration
of their physical and mental characters.</p>

<p>Of the <i>individual</i> order because, thanks to biological variation, every
man is born different from all other men, and men who are born with
superior physical and mental characters tend to rise in the superior classes,
while men who are born with inferior physical and mental characters tend
to fall in the most wretched classes.</p>

<p>However, in studying the catalogues of measurements and observations,
the author has found that in the mass of men belonging to the superior
classes one finds a small number of men with inferior qualities, while in
the mass of men forming the inferior classes one finds a certain number of
men presenting superior characters.</p>

<p>It is between these two <i>exceptional</i> categories that social exchanges
should be made, allowing the best and most capable of the lower stratum
to ascend, and compelling the unadapted who are found above to fall to the
lower stratum.</p>

<i>Directeur de la Statistique Générale de la France.</i></p>


<p>Statistics of families furnish, perhaps, the most appropriate data for
the examination of the factors which govern the productiveness of marriages
or their sterility.</p>

<p>Statistics concerning the children born in the eleven and a half million
French families, classed according to occupation, have been prepared in
France for the first time as a result of the census of 1906. These
statistics give information as to the number of children per family, either
alive on the day of the census or previously deceased, in each occupation,
for all the families in the whole country taken together, and for the
different provinces. Further, a special investigation of the 200,000
families of employees and workmen in the public services has furnished
more circumstantial details, which have enabled the number of children
and number of deaths of children in a family to be brought into relation
with the income of the head.</p>

<p>The results obtained by the method described above are the subject
of this report. The effects of occupation, social position and income are
analysed by means of co-efficients expressing the productiveness of marriages,
after eliminating the influence of such factors as duration of marriage,
age, and habitat, all of which may obviously affect the productiveness of
a marriage.</p>

<p>These results confirm what has been learnt from previous researches
of the fertility of different social classes, but they go further in that they
show that the difference is not exclusively dependent on income.</p>

<p>In general there are more children per family in the families of workmen
than in the families of employers, and the latter contain more than
those of employees other than workmen. Further, one finds industries in
which the number of children in the employers' families is larger than in
the families of workmen in other industries. Thus, differences are introduced
by the occupation. Industries employing many hands seem the
more favourable to the production of large families, both among workmen
and among employers. Agriculture, in which a large number of persons
are engaged in France, does not seem to conduce to fertility. Fishermen
and sailors in the merchant service, on the other hand, appear to form the
class in which fertility is the most considerable.</p>

<p>The importance of the occupational factor is such that we could place
its influence on the same plane as that of "concentration" of population,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with which it is in close relation, since persons following certain classes
of occupation, as, for instance, the members of the liberal professions, and
clerks and other salaried employees are most numerous in towns.</p>

<p>It does not appear that in France casual and unskilled labourers, persons
in the receipt of Poor Law relief, etc., are specially prolific. There is
not thus in reality too much risk of seeing the renewal of the population
carried out in a dangerous manner by its least valuable section. However,
even among the working classes, the most highly paid occupations are not
those among which one finds the greatest number of children.</p>

<p>The economic, social, or moral burden of children is a factor bound
up in a complex manner, not only with the individual conditions of existence,
but also with the transformations of society, progress in manners and
customs, and the conception which one forms of life.</p>

<p>It is this burden which must be allieviated where allieviation would be
most effective and produce the best results, in order to put a stop to a movement
which may be dangerous to civilisation.</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Vernon L. Kellogg</span>.<br />
(<i>Professor in Stanford University, California.</i>)</p>


<p>The claim that war and military service have a directly deteriorating
influence through military selection on a population much given to militarism,
has been clearly stated by von Liebig, Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer,
Tschouriloff, Otto Seeck, David Starr Jordan, and others, not to mention
the ever-anticipating Greeks. Military selection may be conceived to work
disastrously on a population both through the actual killing during war by
wounds and disease of the sturdy young men selected by conscription or
recruiting, and also by the removal from the reproducing part of the
population of much larger numbers of these selected young men both in
war and peace times. Another phase of the racial danger from military
service is the possibility of the contraction of persistent and heritable disease
which may be carried back from camp and garrison with the return of the
soldiers to the population at home.</p>

<p>As likely as seem all these and certain other anti-eugenic influences
arising from military selection, the substantiation of their actual results on
a basis of observed facts is necessary to give them real standing as eugenic
arguments against militarism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer is engaged at present in an attempt to find and expose certain
actual results of military service and war that have direct relation to
racial modification. His paper presents some pertinent facts and figures
already gained. These facts are examined in the light of the criticisms
of such men as Bischoff and Livi, who have recognized the weaknesses in
military and hygienic statistics, and in the light of other opportunities
for error both in the recording and the interpretation of the facts, which
have suggested themselves to him. Also there has to be considered the
possible reality of eugenic advantages from military selection. Seeck and
Ammon believe they have discovered some.</p>

<p>The writer, holding in mind both the dangers of error and the possibility
of eugenic advantage, believes himself nevertheless able to present certain
definite facts showing considerable direct eugenic disadvantage in certain
types of militarism.</p>

<i>University of Turin, Italy.</i></p>


<p>An oligarchy is invariably formed in all political parties for reasons
based partly on individual psychology, partly on crowd psychology, and
partly on the social necessity of party organisation. Under the first head
is grouped the individual's consciousness of his own importance, which with
opportunity develops into the natural human lust for power, and, further,
such individual qualities as native tact, editorial ability, and so on. Crowd
psychology is characterised chiefly by the incompetence of the masses, their
dependence upon traditional methods of party government, and their feeling
of gratitude to leaders who have suffered for the cause. Finally, the
necessity for party organisations grows with every increase of numbers
and extension of functions. It is physically impossible for large party
groups to govern themselves directly. All parties live in a state of perpetual
warfare with opposing parties, and, if they are revolutionary in character,
with the social order itself. Tactical considerations, therefore, and,
above all, the necessity of maintaining a condition of military preparedness,
strengthen the hands of the controlling clique within the party and render
every day more impossible genuine democracy.</p>

<p>The selective or eugenic value of party organization is that it allows men
gifted with certain qualities to rise above their fellows into positions of
superiority, which, for the considerations set forth above, are more or less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
permanent. This value is of the greater importance because the opportunities
for able and ambitious workmen to rise by the economic ladder to the
rank of employers are rapidly disappearing, at any rate, in old countries.</p>

<p>The qualities necessary for a successful party leader are discussed.
Briefly stated, they consist of oratorical ability, which is partly a psychical and
partly a physiological and anatomical character; energy of will; superiority
of intellect and knowledge; a depth of conviction often bordering on
fanaticism and self-confidence, pushed even to the point of self-conceit.
Also in many countries, as for instance Italy, physical beauty is important
in helping a man to rise, while in rarer cases goodness of heart and disinterestedness
influence the crowd by reawakening religious sentiments.</p>

<p>We have seen that some elements of the crowd are seized by the selecting-machine
of the party organisation that raises them above their companions,
increasing automatically the social distance between them and their followers.
To put this automatical selecting-machine into action, certain individuals
appear, possessing special physical and intellectual gifts that distinguish
them spontaneously from the mass of the party.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCIIICHVI" id="SCIIICHVI">THE INFLUENCE OF RACE ON HISTORY.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">W. C. D. and C. D. Whetham</span>.</p>


<p>The history of Europe presents a long series of nations successively rising
and falling in the scale of prosperity and influence. Such persistent alternations
suggest a common cause underlying the phenomena. All history is
the record of change. The outward change as recorded by the chronicler
has probably its counterpart in unnoticed variations of the internal
biological structure of the nation.</p>

<p>Most nations are composite in character. They contain two or more
racial stocks, fulfilling different functions in the national life. It is
probable that the proportion in which these stocks are present is not always
constant. The variation in proportion is possibly the agent effecting the
internal change in structure, which becomes manifest outwardly in the rise
or decline of the nation.</p>

<p>The physical characters of the population of Europe during historic
times indicate three chief races: (1) the Mediterranean, (2) the Alpine, (3)
the Northern. The individuals of these races possess also distinct mental
and intellectual attributes, and the history of Europe is fundamentally the
story of the interaction of the three races.</p>

<p>It is suggested that the supreme power of Greece and Rome, each in its
own direction, was due to the attainment of a fortunate balance between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the social and political functions of the constituents of the nation, the
directing power being supplied chiefly by the invaders of northern race,
who formed the dominant class among the southern indigenous Mediterranean
population. In each case, the northern elements grew gradually less,
through such agencies as losses in war, the selective action of a differential
birth rate, and by racial merging into the more numerous southern stock.</p>

<p>The outburst of artistic genius and intellectual pre-eminence which
marked the Renaissance in North Italy may perhaps be due to a similar
racial composition, the northern elements being supplied by the descendants
of the barbarian invaders of the later Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Great Britain has also similar racial elements. The Mediterranean
race, spreading up the shores of the Atlantic, enters largely into the
composition of the people of the south-west. The northern element,
immigrant from the shores of the Baltic and North Sea, is strongest in the
east and north.</p>

<p>We know that there are now at work two influences affecting the
average racial character of the English nation; (1) the increase in the
urban population at the expense of the rural, (2) the voluntary restriction
of the birth rate which affects certain sections of all classes more than
others. It is probable that both these changes tend to favour selectively
the southern racial elements at the expense of the northern. Eventually,
the present structure of society may become unstable in consequence of this
racial alteration, and the necessary readjustment, in its turn, will contribute a
chapter to history.</p>

HISTORICAL RESEARCH.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Frederick Adams Woods</span>, M.D.,<br />
<i>Harvard Medical School.</i></p>


<p>The relative influence of heredity and environment has long been a
subject for debate, but, for the most part, such debates have not been profitable.
It is true that heredity cannot be separated from environment if only
one individual be considered; but as soon as we inquire into the causes of
the differences between man and man, it is perfectly possible to gain real
light on this subject, so important to the advocates of eugenics. Everything
must be made a problem of differences. The mathematical measurements
of resemblances between relatives close of kin will sometimes serve. At
other times, the correlation co-efficient is of no avail, and only an intensive
study of detailed pedigrees will bring out such differences as cannot be due
to the action of surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>History and genealogy both speak unmistakably for heredity. Men
of genius have as many eminent relationships as the expectations of heredity
demand. The same is true among the highest aristocratic classes, and is
equally true under democratic government, as is proved by a study of the
family history of those Americans whose names are in the Hall of Fame.
History shows that about half of the early monarchs were not cruel or were
not licentious. Alternative heredity can well account for that. Virtuous
types have only slightly increased in numerical proportion. Environment
cannot be very effective; but there are biological factors of a more hidden
nature which are silently making for progress. Mental qualities are correlated
with moral; and in the European dynasties the survivors have been
generally the descendants of the morally superior.</p>

<p>Physical differences can also be demonstrated, coming in the course of
generations. A study of the portraits of royal, noble, and other historical
personages shows that the bony framework of the face, especially about
the nose and eyes, has changed rapidly since the beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>In explaining the rise and fall of nations, gametic and personal causes
can be measured and marked. All the evidence of history points to the
power and importance of a very few great personalities&mdash;they themselves
the product of inborn forces. These have been the chief causes of political
and economic differences, but non-gametic (environmental) causation can be
occasionally detected, and separated out; as, for instance, the modern scientific
productivity in Germany and the proportionate intellectual activity among
women in America. It is estimated that there are four hundred thousand
books on history. These form an almost unworked mine of information,
easily available to every student of eugenics. It is high time that the human
record, so ancient in its beginnings, should be used to contribute to that most
modern of sciences, the improvement of the human breed.</p>

<p>Tables of mortality relating to human beings with classification as to age,

that man during the period of development has a much heavier death-rate.
It is not possible to say whether in their natural state the higher kinds of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
more likely. It remains to be determined whether the heavy death-rate during
development which the human race shows in the comparison is a distinctive
natural characteristic belonging to it, or whether it is rather the result of
the more or less artificial circumstances in which man is born and reared.</p>

<p>The human race differs as regards reproduction and the rearing of its
offspring from the higher species of animals in their natural state, chiefly
in three ways: (<i>a</i>) In the case of the human race reproduction takes place
at all times of the year, whilst the higher animals have one single period for
reproducing, or, in some cases, two or three periods; (<i>b</i>) animals reproduce
as soon as the organism becomes capable of reproduction, whilst in civilised
human races as a rule a longer or shorter period elapses between the time
when the individual becomes capable of reproduction and the time he
actually begins to reproduce; (<i>c</i>) in civilised man the development of altruistic
sentiments protects weak and sickly persons from the eliminating action
of natural selection, and often enables them to take part in the procreation
of future generations.</p>

<p>The paper of A. has for its object to examine closely these three arguments
based upon very extensive data taken partly from demographic statistics
and partly from researches made personally by him or which he caused
to be made, especially in the Municipal Statistical Offices of Rome and
Cagliari, and in the Obstetrical Clinic of Bologna. The principal results
are here indicated.</p>

<p>A. The rule of a greater number of conceptions in Spring observed in
temperate regions suffers notable exceptions in tropical and arctic regions.
Hence there is a weakening of the idea that in it one should recognise the
atavistic heritage of a special season for reproduction which the human race
had originally shown, analogous to what one finds to-day in many species of
animals. On the other hand, neither the frequency of multiple births, of
miscarriages, or of stillbirths, nor the length of life of offspring nor their
intellectual capacity show any correlation whatever with the season of conception.
The frequency of stillbirths, however, and the length of life of
the offspring show a clear correlation with the season of birth, in the sense
that those born in temperate seasons show a lower rate for stillbirths and a
greater length of life.</p>

<p>B. The age of the mother at the time of parturition does not show
any regular influence on the size and weight of the child. It has a very
sensible influence on the frequency of miscarriages and of stillbirths; this
increases with the increase in age. The age of the mother at the time of
marriage exercises a decisive influence upon the vitality of the offspring: the
greater the age of the mother at the time of marriage the less will be the
vitality of the children.</p>

<p>The age of the father at the birth of his child has some influence on the
number of stillbirths among his children. This influence&mdash;at any rate above
a given age&mdash;increases with the increase in the father's age. It can neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be disproved nor affirmed that the age of the father at the time of marriage
has an influence upon the vitality of the children; it is certain, however,
that if any influence of that kind exists it is much less intense than that
exercised by the age of the mother.</p>

<p>There has also been an enquiry as to the effect upon the characters of the
offspring exerted by (1) order of birth; (2) difference in age of the parents;
and (3) the age of the woman at the first menstruation.</p>

<p>C. Persons who die at a more advanced age have children in greater
number and endowed with greater length of life. For some classes of the
unfit (mad, consumptives, suicides) it can be proved beyond question that the
number of children born is less and their mortality greater than among
married people generally. Those who die of heart disease or of cancer
show a number of children slightly higher than the general average of
married persons; but that can be attributed to the fact that their age at
death is greater than the average age at death of married people.</p>

ISLAND, STATE CENSUS OF 1905.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Frederick L. Hoffman</span>, LL.D., F.S.S.,<br />
<i>Statistician of the Prudential Insurance Company of America.</i></p>


<p>As a contribution to the practical study of eugenics the decennial maternity
statistics of Rhode Island are of exceptional interest and importance.</p>

<p>In 1905, of 36,766 native-born married women 26,329 (71.6%) were
mothers, and 10,477 (28.4%) childless. Of 32,960 foreign-born married
women 27,207 (82.5%) were mothers, and 5,753 (17.5%) childless. Contrasting
these percentages, the fact requires only to be stated to emphasize
its profound and far-reaching social as well as political significance.</p>

<p>Considered with reference to religious belief, 72.7% of Protestant and
80.3% of Roman Catholic married women were mothers. Of married
women of Jewish faith 88.0% were mothers.</p>

<p>At ages 25-34, the proportion of native-born mothers having only one
child was 35.1%, against 22.6% for the foreign-born; the proportion of
mothers having from six to ten children was 6.8% for the native-born,
against 12.9% for the foreign-born. At all ages a similar disproportion is
apparent.</p>

<p>Vastly more important than the multitude of general social and economic
facts are these statistics of what, for want of a better term, may be called
<i>human production</i>, and which disclose what must be considered the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
alarming tendency in American life. Granting that excessively large
families are not desirable, at least from an economic point of view, it
cannot be questioned that the diminution in the average size of the family,
and the increase in the proportion of childless families among the native-born
stock is evidence of physical deterioration, and must have a lasting and
injurious effect on national life and character.</p>

EUGENIC EFFECT.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Dr. H. Hallopeau</span>.</p>


<p>Syphilis is strongly <i>dysgenic</i>; it causes the production of profoundly
damaged children; in preventing it the physician co-operates effectively with
eugenic action. In order to prevent the propagation of this disease we
must have recourse to <i>administrative prophylaxis</i>, <i>prophylaxis by persuasion</i>,
and <i>prophylaxis by medical measures</i>.</p>

<p><i>Administrative prophylaxis</i> must act especially by multiplying gratuitous
consultations and in securing, as far as possible, hospital treatment for persons
affected by transmissible lesions, especially for prostitutes.</p>

<p>To the physician belongs the duty of acting by <i>persuasion</i> in pointing
out to syphilitics that they have no right to have children so long as they
are liable to transmit their disease to their offspring.</p>

<p>We must abort syphilis if it is in the stage of primary invasion: this
invasion is not, as was believed until recently, confined to the chancre and its
accompanying swellings; it includes all the intermediate stage; in order to
destroy the tripanosomes we must use repeated injections of
<i>benzosulfoneparaminophenylarsinate
of soda</i>, commonly known as <i>hectine</i> (Mouneyrat),
the only specific medicament which is well borne locally.</p>

<p>Results similar to those we have just shown are obtained by making, in a
given region, two or three injections of salvarsan. However, the comparison
between the two medications is altogether in favour of that by
hectine. Indeed, experience proves that the secondary generalization is
noticeably more frequent after injections of salvarsan, and, besides, these
are far from being always painless. We have made known to the Académie
of Medicine a case in which, within 48 hours, they caused the death of a
young man in good health. Several similar cases have since been notified,
particularly by Dr. Gaucher. Confidently believing in the axiom "Primo
non nocere," we explicitly declare ourselves adversaries of a practice which
brings such accidents in its train.</p>

<p>In the secondary stage, we must have recourse simultaneously to various
specific agents.</p>

<p>Procreation may be permitted when six months after the abortive treatment
Wasserman's reaction, after several trials, has given uniformly negative
results.</p>

<p>The physician thus accomplishes a profoundly eugenic work in favouring
and accelerating the production of unspoilt children.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="SCIVCHII" id="SCIVCHII">THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON THE GERM-PLASM.</a></p>

<p class="caption3">(<span class="smcap">The New Alcohol Legislation in Norway.</span>)</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">Dr. Alfred Mjoën</span>.</p>


<p>The injurious effect of alcohol depends not only upon the amount taken,
but also upon other factors, as, <i>e.g.</i>, upon its dilution, and upon the kind
of nourishment taken with it. There can be no doubt that alcohol under
a certain percentage neither injures nor can injure either the somatic cells,
or what is more important for race-hygiene, the germ cells. And, on the
other hand, it must be regarded as proved that alcohol over a certain percentage
is injurious to the quality of the offspring, not alone where the
mother drinks (influence upon the embryo), but also where the father alone
is a drinker (destruction of the germ). The latest investigations in this
field confirm this assumption.</p>

<p>There is, it is true, a middle class of beverages whose influence upon the
germ-plasm (posterity) has not been established, or can be established at all.
As a general rule, one may lay down the rule: <i>The injurious effect of an
alcoholic beverage upon individuals or race increases from a certain percentage
progressively with its increasing contents of alcohol.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, I propose to divide alcoholic liquors into classes, and to deal
with them according to the amount of their contents of alcohol, <i>i.e.</i>, according
to their injuriousness.</p>

<p>All casks, bottles, etc., coming into the market are to be furnished with
the class-mark (<i>e.g.</i>, I., II., III., branded upon the cord).</p>

<p>For example, in the case of beer, the first class (under 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>%), shall be
obtainable everywhere. For this class there will be claimed, besides a
reduction of duty, also a facility for sale and some concessions. Class I.
(up to 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>%) will be charged with 2 ore; Class II. (2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>&mdash;3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>%) with 8 ore;
and Class III. (3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>&mdash;5%) with 15-16 ore per litre. Beer over 5% or 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>%
will be prohibited(<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>).</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This proposal was
favourably received by the Norwegian minister Knudsen,
and brought before the Storthing as a Government measure. The proposal has been
accepted as part of the election programme of the Radicals, the Socialist Democrats,
and all total abstinence organisations.</p>
</div>

<p>The class system permits of a simple, cheap, and practicable control, and,
indeed, a control which is not confined to the brewery or to any single stage
of preparation, but which follows the article over the whole country from
its origin to its consumption. When alcoholic drinks are marked with
their class and placed under State control, the consumers will themselves
easily exercise the control. And the public will gradually become accustomed
to form an opinion upon the influence of the various articles upon
the working capacity and the health, not only of the individual, but also of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the family and the race. State and country authorities will, with State-controlled
classes, more easily see justice done on all sides. This last
advantage will, naturally, only avail in those lands where the permission
to sell alcoholic liquors is vested in the local authorities. The progressive
class system will also give the State, the municipalities, and also private
labour organisations an opportunity to support those restaurants and inns
which supply nothing but pure and harmless liquors, and consumption will
undergo a slow and gradual change to the lightest drinks.</p>

<p>At the present time the lightest kinds of beer are too heavily taxed in
comparison with the heaviest kinds, and the latter in turn are too heavily
taxed in comparison with brandy. From the point of view of race-hygiene,
the fight must be directed especially against the fourth and most dangerous
class, namely, all kinds of brandy (prohibition or Ivan Bratt's system),
as well as against the mixed wines, which are so often adulterated and
injurious.</p>

<p class="caption3">Statistics from the Central Bureau for the Management of the Insane of
Paris and the Department of the Seine from 1867 to 1912.</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">M. Magnan</span>,<br />
<i>Chief Physician to the Central Bureau, Member of the Academy of
Medicine</i>,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Dr. Fillassier</span>.</p>


<p>From 1869 to 1912 the number of sick persons received at the Central
Bureau of the St. Anne Asylum has gone on steadily increasing: occasionally
signs of a falling off are noticed, quickly compensated by the number of
entries for the following years.</p>

<p>Among these patients a great number are driven to the asylum by the
abuse of alcoholic drinks. Some of these are simple alcoholics, <i>i.e.</i>, those who
owe their insanity entirely to excessive drinking; the others make up the
numerous group of degenerates, who are for the most part descendants of
alcoholics, and on whom fall all the forms of physical, intellectual, and
moral degradation.</p>

<p>For these last, alcohol has been but the touch of the trigger which has
put in action their disposition towards insanity; the attack of mania, when
past, leaves revealed psychic troubles, which, but for the turning of the
balance by alcohol, would have remained in the latent condition, but which,
once developed, remain often for a much longer time; so we see the increase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in the number of these patients&mdash;occasional drunkards&mdash;keeping pace with
that of chronic alcoholics.</p>

<p>These will specially call forth the interest of the members of the Eugenic
Congress. From the clinical point of view they exhibit great importance;
for showing as they do all the episodic syndromes of degeneracy, all the
mental forms of it may be seen&mdash;maniacal, melancholic, idiotic: insanities
polymorphous or systematic, fixed ideas, monomanias connected with words
or numbers, every sort of phobia, obsession, impulse, and symptomatic
manifestation of great importance. When their objective lies in sexual
perversion, theft, arson, murder, etc., these various states raise the most
delicate questions whether from the point of view of philosophy, psychology,
sociology, or forensic medicine.</p>

<p>This class of society, in the grip of this poison, is unfortunately not
sterile; their miserable descendants come to dock in the asylum; so much so
that if we mass together the various elements, if we add the unfortunates
permanently disabled, such as epileptics, and the increasing crowd of feeble-minded,
idiotic, tuberculous children, the mind recoils aghast at the gravity of
the danger. The necessity of an implacable war against alcoholism, which
crowds our asylums, our hospitals, and our homes with insane persons,
and sends a constant stream to our prisons and reformatories&mdash;such a war
must be the principal aim of the Eugenics Congress.</p>

<p>For long the evil genius of mankind, alcoholism has to-day laid its clutch
on women, and the admission figures now show their numbers on the increase
every year.</p>

<p>Such are the lessons which may be learnt from the report of Magnan and
Fillassier.</p>

<p>1. Among the agencies under social control which impair the racial
qualities of future generations, an important place is taken by the Science
of Medicine, especially by Obstetrics. For the increase of obstetrics
increases the incapacity for bearing children of future generations.</p>

<p>2. The great difference in the capacity for bearing children between the
primitive and civilized races depends only in part on the lessened fitness of
the latter due to the increase of skilled assistance.</p>

<p>3. Incapacity for bearing children can be acquired; it develops, however,
abundantly on the grounds of a congenital predisposition.</p>

<p>4. In so far as the latter is the case, obstetrics contributes towards the
diffusion of this incapacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The most serious obstacles to delivery are effected by deformities of
the pelvis, in at least 90% of which heredity plays a part. In this
connection, rickets, the predisposition to which is inherited, takes the foremost
place.</p>

<p>6. German medical statistics make it appear probable that incapacity to
bear children is on the increase.</p>

<p>7. Medical help in childbirth brings, undoubtedly, numerical advantage
to the race, but it endangers the quality of the race in other ways than
through the fostering of unfitness for bearing.</p>

<p>8. The danger of the increase of incapacity for bearing through the
increase of assistance in childbirth can be combatted:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Through the renunciation of descendants by women unfitted to bear
children.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Through an energetic campaign against rickets, to which only the
predisposition can be inherited.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Through the permeation of obstetrics with the spirit of eugenics, so that
the obstetrician no longer proceeds according to a settled rule (living
mother and living child), but in each separate case takes into consideration
the interests of the race.</p>

increase of registered insanity in London; the causes of the increase.
(1) The standard of insanity has been raised. (2) The increase of accommodation
for reception of the insane. The diminishing death rate in
asylums causing a progressive accumulation. The diminished number of
recoveries. (3) The large proportion of old people admitted to asylums
formerly in the infirmaries.</p>

<p><i>Nature.</i>&mdash;The study of pedigrees in hospital and asylum patients showing
the importance of heredity in nervous and mental diseases. The nature
of the neuropathic tendency; its transmission in different forms of nervous
and mental disease in successive generations. Its latency and re-appearance

arrived at in relation to heredity and insanity from a study by a card
system of 3,118 related persons who are at present, or who have been,
in the London County asylums. Among the 20,000 inmates at present
resident, 715 are so closely related as parents and offspring or brothers
and sisters. Nature is always trying to end or mend a degenerate stock
if left to itself. Analysis of data regarding first attack of insanity in
464 parents and their 508 offspring; the signal tendency to the occurrence
of the disease in a more intense form and at an earlier age in the offspring.
This "antedating" or "anticipation" in relation to Nature's process
of elimination of the unfit. Nearly 50 per cent. of the offspring affected
20 years earlier than the parent. The same found in uncles and aunts
with nephews and nieces, only not nearly so marked. Seeing that the
unfit are at present able to survive; does nature end or mend degenerate
stocks, or have the lines of neuropathic inheritance only been partially
cut off by this tendency to "anticipation"? What we want to know is:
What is the fate of all the offspring of an insane parent or parents; for
there are a great many facts which show that a disease may be latent and
re-appear in a stock when the conditions of mating or environment are
unfavourable? A collection of pedigrees is required which will prove
conclusively that the offspring of insane parents, who are free from the
insane manifestations during adolescence, will breed children who will
not become insane. Supposing it were shown that cases discharged as
recovered had the seeds of insanity, by the fact that their progeny were
feeble-minded, epileptic, or insane, it would be a clear indication of taking
measures to prevent them handing on the disease. Recurrent insanity&mdash;the
birth of children in the sane intervals. Analysis of pedigrees with a dual
neuropathic inheritance of maternal and paternal stocks compared with
single neuropathic inheritance. Conclusion that a child born of neuropathic
inheritance in both ancestral stocks stands, on an average, the chance
of being insane four times as great as when only one stock is affected.
Are there any types of insanity especially liable to be transmitted
in the same form or another form? The prediction of the racial
value of an individual inheritance can only be predicted by a study of
what a man was born with&mdash;Nature, and what happened after birth&mdash;Nurture.</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By <span class="smcap">H. E. Jordan</span>,<br />
<i>Chairman of the Eugenics Section of the American Association for the
Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality.</i></p>


<p>The Science of Eugenics deserves a place in the medical curriculum for
three reasons. Firstly: Medicine is fast becoming a science of the prevention
of weakness and morbidity; their permanent not temporary cure,
their racial eradication rather than their personal palliation. Eugenic conduct
is undeniably a factor in attaining the speedy achievement of the end
of racial health. Eugenics, embracing genetics, is thus one of the important
disciplines among the future medical sciences. The coming physician
must have adequate training in matters relating to heredity and Eugenics.
Secondly: as the general population becomes better educated in matters of
personal and racial health and hygiene it will more and more demand
advice regarding the prevention of weakness in themselves and their offspring.
The physicians are logically the men who must give it. Thirdly:
physicians will be more efficient public servants if they approach their work
with the Eugenic outlook on life.</p>

<p>Instruction in Eugenics, in the form of a number of special lectures on
the subject, is already given in some of our medical schools. This indicates
at least that the need is felt and the importance of such knowledge to the
best physician recognised. Since not all of the better medical schools give
such courses, however, we may infer that there are obstacles in the way.
What is the nature of these?</p>

<p>One such may be the lack of adequate preparation on the part of the
students in the fundamentals of biology to properly comprehend the import
and application of Eugenic facts. This obstacle is speedily being removed;
for considerable biological training is already a medical course prerequisite.
But there may be a lack of properly prepared teachers to present this
subject to even properly prepared medical students. This obstacle is also
fast disappearing. Once the demand for this kind of help is voiced,
there will appear properly trained teachers to instruct physicians.</p>

<p>Another obstacle may be raised by short-sighted and self-seeking
physicians, for whom less illness and weakness may mean less work and a
reduced income. But this is, perhaps, only a relatively very small factor
in, and also only a passing phase of, the opposition, and will soon correct
itself.</p>

<p>The most encouraging prospect for this new scheme of activity is the
deep interest shown by young medical students in matters of heredity and
Eugenics.</p>

<p class="caption3">(Abstract.)</p>

<p class="caption3">By Dr. <span class="smcap">Raoul Dupuy</span>.</p>


<p>When we speak of a backward child, we mean any subject which is arrested
or retarded more or less completely in its bodily, psychical, and sensorial
evolution, in consequence of congenital and acquired lesions, or simply in consequence
of physiological troubles, which concern, either at the same or a
different time, the brain and the glands of internal secretion (the thyroid, the
hypophysis, the suprarenals, and the genital glands). The cerebral lesions,
practically incurable in the present state of science, produce "atropic backwardness"
the functional troubles of the brain, or those caused by the glands
of internal secretion, which can be modified by "combined organotherapy"
produce dystrophic backwardness. We also, however, find mixed types, half
of the one and half of the other, which are similarly susceptible of improvement.
The number, and above all the variety of the types of dystrophic
backwardness, makes a general classification of them impossible. The study
of their bodily, psychical and sensorial anomalies proves that in most of the
manifestations of backwardness and immaturity, these children present
perversions of evolution which have a common bearing on the development of
body, mind and spirit. Although apparently different from one another, these
backward persons, whether the mischief be corporal, psychical or sensorial,
show pathological peculiarities, which prove that the cause of their various
dystrophies have a similar origin, and that they often arise from defective
function of the sympathic system which appears to be brought into action by
the internal glands. The backward children consist of intoxicated, under-grown
or anæmic persons, who, besides, suffer from retention of substances,
which ought normally to be eliminated, chiefly the chlorides and phosphates
(in cases of apathy) or the hyper excretion of the same substances (in cases of
instability). Moreover, the combined organotherapy ought to be considered
as a "perfect touchstone" of dystrophy, and if applied according to certain
rules, it gives results which are more complete and more certain than thyroid
organotherapy by itself. It goes without saying that a special training is
necessary for the intellectual "backwards"; but before any attempt at
education, it is necessary to treat their bodily deficiencies, and to place them
in the special schools with the boarding system, where they will be under the
eye both of the doctor and of the teacher.</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Exhibited by Professor von Gruber.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_1"></a>C 1 &amp; 2</div>

<p>Experiments by P. Kammerer on <span class="undrln">changes produced in the colours
in the skin of the Fire Salamander&mdash;Salamandra maculosa&mdash;by
keeping them on yellow or black earth respectively</span>.</p>

<p>According as to whether the animals are kept on yellow or
black earth the yellow or black colouring of the skin spreads, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E2" id="Page_E2">[E2]</a></span>
this change of colour appears in the same way in the offspring,
though a direct influence of the colour of the earth on the germ plasm
is absolutely unthinkable. The two pictures in the lower part of
Figure C 1 show the colouring of that generation to which the animal
portrayed above belongs, according as to whether they have been kept
permanently on yellow soil (right) or returned again to black soil (left).
Here, it is true, it is not a question of a new quality or tendency.
The capacity in the parents to deposit black pigment in their
skin has been increased or decreased according to their surroundings.
But the distinctive point remains, that their offspring is subsequently
endowed with the inherited tendency to produce proportionately more
or less pigment. This may, however, be a direct result of the
abnormal life conditions of the parents, in so far as the depositing
of more or less pigment in the skin of the parents is certainly not
a purely local process, but rather is bound up with other metabolic
changes which may extend to or influence the developing gametes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_3"></a>C 3 &amp; 4</div>

<p>Very remarkable are the <span class="undrln">hereditary changes</span> which Kammerer
established in <span class="undrln">Alytes obstetricans</span>&mdash;the midwife toad.</p>

<p>With them copulation normally takes place on dry land. The
male extricates from the female the string of eggs, winds it round his
hind legs and carries it about until the eggs are ready. Then, and not
till then, he enters the water where the larvæ escape. If, however, one
keeps these toads in a high temperature (25-30 C.) they enter
the water to cool themselves and abandon their normal way of
manipulating their brood because the string of spawn swells in water
and does not remain sufficiently sticky to allow the male to fasten
it to his thighs. The animals become gradually accustomed to
live in water, and continue to carry on the business of reproduction
there, even when the temperature is normal. As soon as the new
instinct has become sufficiently established with the parents they
beget offspring, which at a normal temperature go of their own accord
into water to deposit their eggs, and also produce eggs more numerous
than, and somewhat different from, those of the normal toad. Further,
the males of this succeeding generation develop thumbs and forearms
of a character which enables them to perform the difficult task
of holding the females during copulation in the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_5"></a>C 5 &amp; 6</div>

<p>The likeness of offspring to their parents is extremely great and
goes into many details; this we frequently overlook because a divergence
strikes us more than a similarity. A similarity becomes
striking when it is a question of familiar peculiarities. These often
relate to exterior unimportant peculiarities. Our collection contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E3" id="Page_E3">[E3]</a></span>
<span class="undrln">a pedigree</span> (taken by Dr. Walter Bell from Bateson's "Mendel's
Principles of Heredity"), Figure C 5, <span class="undrln">of a family with peculiarly
curled hair</span>; also in Figure C 6, a <span class="undrln">case of heredity of a lock of white
hair</span>, likewise taken from Bateson's work by Rizzoli.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_7"></a>C 7</div>

<p>The heredity of physical qualities is strikingly illustrated in
Weinberg's Table C 7, showing the age <span class="undrln">at death of the parents and
the marital gross and nett fertility</span>. It is founded on the Stuttgart
family registers, and comprises about 1,900 non-tubercular and
about 3,000 tubercular families ("Archiv für Rassen and
Gesellschafts Biologie" and Württemberger Jahrbücher für Statistik
und Landeskunde, 1911). W. Weinberg adds:</p>

<p class="caption2">Figure C 7.</p>
</div>

<p>"The gross as well as the nett fertility of those which have
died increases with the age attained, the latter, however, in a
greater degree, because the mortality of children decreases with the
greater age attained at death. With the wife the curve is less steep
and less regular, because in her case mortality is unfavourably
influenced by the birth functions; this is particularly plainly seen
in the case of tuberculous women, when the curve has two peaks."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_8"></a>C 8</div>

<p>The same fact of heredity of "constitution" is demonstrated
in Weinberg's Table C 8 showing the <span class="undrln">age at death of the parents and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E4" id="Page_E4">[E4]</a></span>
the mortality of the children up to the age of 20.</span> It is based on
the same material as Table 7 and proves: "With the increasing
age of the parents child mortality decreases, especially so in the
case of the children of the tuberculous, and the number of children
reaching the age of sexual maturity increases correspondingly."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_9"></a>C 9 &amp; 10</div>

<p>The same is proved by the two Tables C 9 and 10 by Ploëtz
referring to <span class="undrln">age at death of fathers and mothers and child
mortality up to the age of five years</span>. Very striking in both
these tables is the extremely low mortality of the offspring of the
parents with the greatest longevity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_11"></a>C 11</div>

<p>Table C 11 by Weinberg: <span class="undrln">Hereditary of the disposition to beget
twins</span> (Archiv für Rassen &amp; Gesellschafts Biologie VI. 1909) is
remarkable. "The difference in favour of sisters speaks for
Mendel's law of dominance and recessivity. The more twins a
woman has borne, the more frequently the same phenomena is found
in her nearest female relations." That the mortality among twins
is very great is a well-known fact.</p>

<p>Figure C 13 showing the inheritance of progressive muscular
<span class="undrln">atrophy</span> (after Eichhorst).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_14"></a>C 14</div>

<p>Figure C 14 a partial reproduction of a <span class="undrln">pedigree</span> comprising over
2,000 people of the family Nongaret suffering from inherited
stationary night <span class="undrln">blindness</span> (compiled by  Cunier, Truc and
Nettleship). With regard to these figures it is to be noted that only
a fraction of the offspring is affected with the illness, the remainder
being perfectly normal. It is remarkable with the bleeders
(Hæmophilic persons) that the females do not suffer from the disease
though they transfer it to their male offspring; a similar latent
disposition is observable in other hereditary conditions, especially
colour-blindness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_15"></a>C 15</div>

<p>W. Weinberg shows in Table C 15 the <span class="undrln">frequency of tuberculosis
within families</span>. He adds: "This is a comparison of the
experiences of married tubercular individuals, regarding the frequency
of tuberculosis among their parents, brothers and sisters, with the
corresponding experiences of their husbands or wives who come on an
average from similar surroundings. The experiences of the latter
represent the normal expectation. It is especially striking that the family
influence tells most with the children of the well-to-do." The well-known
fact that the tuberculous frequently come from tuberculous
stock is clearly demonstrated in the figures of this table.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_16"></a>C 16</div>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_17"></a>C 17</div>

<p>In Table C 16 Dr. Otto Diem shows the <span class="undrln">distribution of particular
taints</span> in every hundred of the tainted members <span class="undrln">among the nearest
relations</span> (parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E6" id="Page_E6">[E6]</a></span>
of the entire material he deals with. It is shown for instance that
with the mentally sound, 15% of the tainted relatives were mentally
diseased against 45.9% with the mentally diseased. Figure C 17
shows the share of this percentage among the parents only. It is
demonstrated that with the mentally diseased a much larger percentage
of the total hereditary taint is traceable to parental madness,
alcoholism, abnormality of character, than with the mentally sound.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_18"></a>C 18</div>

<p>Figure C 18 corresponds, with figure C 17, except that not only the
parents are reckoned but the nearest defective relative in any degree.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_19"></a>C 19</div>

<p>Figure C 19 teaches that the reckoning of all the taints in the ancestry
taken together with the collaterals fails to give as clear and convincing
a picture of the dissimilarity in the heredity of mentally
sound and diseased, as the reckoning of the taints among the parents
alone. The establishment of the hereditary taint in the direct
ancestry appears therefore by far the more important.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_20"></a>C 20</div>

<p>In Figure 144 (Journal f. Psychologie und Neurologie. XIII.
Bd.) Drf. Hans W. Mayer gives a number of examples of <span class="undrln">heredity
among moral imbeciles</span>, and he draws the following conclusions:
"Consequently moral defect in frequent combination with alcoholism
is hereditary in the highest degree. Remedy: Incarceration of these
dangerous individuals, not according to the accidental form of the
crime committed, but as diseased and forming a public danger. If
there is a risk of escape or if liberty is conceded&mdash;undoubtedly
sterilization to prevent perpetuation of the defect." This latter
course is already followed in North America, and a start has been
made with it in Switzerland, at least in cases where the consent of
the patients is obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_21"></a>C 21</div>

<p>The pedigree of the <span class="undrln">family of Zero von Jorger</span>, figure C 21
(Archiv für Rassen &amp; Gesellschafts biologie I.), shows in a convincing
manner how very important for the protection of society is
the prevention of the reproduction of the degenerate. In the course
of time this family has burdened the sound and fit with taxation
amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds. The author remarks:
"The family Zero springs from good peasant stock intermarrying
with homeless female tramps. Its history shows how alcohol
(especially spirits) and bad environment (in this case always
combined) may create a scourge to society which continues from
generation to generation. The family has produced many criminals,
lunatics and feeble-minded persons. The offspring of these are destined
to die out. Their great fertility at times is counteracted by great infant
mortality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E7" id="Page_E7">[E7]</a></span></p>

<p>"In places regeneration is evident which invariably is
inaugurated by marriage with a good woman and the consequent
abandonment of the abuse of alcohol. As with the degeneration so
with the regeneration the wife takes the leading part."</p>

<p>The question whether modern civilized races are degenerate in
body and mind is much disputed. In some respects for instance in
the increase of myopia and caries of the teeth it is generally
admitted, but in others it is doubtful, though it may be considered
an established fact that the general average of health among all
civilized nations is unsatisfactory. We do not know for certain
whether the general level of all or certain qualities is being lowered
or not, and still less can we say what part is played by heredity.</p>

<p>The demand for the systematic collection of data on these points
is the first which Race Hygiene has to make from Governments.</p>

<p>The examinations as to fitness for military service in
Germany might offer an excellent index of the physique of the people,
but for this purpose the physical condition of the conscripts would
have to be recorded in a much more thorough manner than at present
(S. Gruber Concordia, 1916). There appears, however, to be no
doubt that in general the country and agricultural pursuits produce
young men of better average health than do towns and other
occupations. This agrees with the fact that the life of the inhabitants
in rural districts and of those engaged in agriculture is longer than
that of town dwellers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_22"></a>C 22</div>

<p>Table C 22 <span class="undrln">compares</span> the<span class="undrln"> duration of life</span> of men living <span class="undrln">in towns
with</span> those living in <span class="undrln">rural districts in Prussia</span>. Beyond all doubt
the peasant population is still constitutionally the most valuable
part of the people, and the colonisation at home, such as the
Prussian Government is pursuing to an increasing degree, may
become of the very highest value for the improvement of the race.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_23"></a>C 23, 24 &amp; 25</div>

<p>Dr. Walter Abelsdorff gives the following explanations to Table
C 23, and figures C 24 and C 25. "They endeavour to show the
number of <span class="undrln">families brought 'back to the land' in North Germany</span> in the
years 1900-1910."</p>

<p>"The Royal Commission for settlement in West Prussia and
Posen has achieved notable results since the beginning of its activity
in 1886. This body has brought about from 1886 to 1910 the settlement
in the country of 18,507 families, 18,127 in leaseholds and 305
in labourers' dwellings. For 1900 to 1910 the total number of
families settled amount to 14,511."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E8" id="Page_E8">[E8]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Royal General Commission began its activity later, but
since 1906 has been energetically pursuing the settlement of agricultural
labourers. At Münster, in the years 1908 to 1910, 247
leasehold small holdings for artisans have been created."</p>

<p>"The results of the Royal District Administrations are as yet
less considerable, those of private societies with State subvention,
though irregular, are worthy of note."</p>

<p>"The total work of settlement is almost exclusively effected by
the Commission for settlements and the General Commission."</p>

<p>"Counting five members to each family, 130,000 people have
been brought into economically improved conditions. In how far
this may benefit the second generation&mdash;the children of the settlers&mdash;cannot
as yet be determined."</p>

<p>"These efforts, however, may be looked upon as a regenerative
component among the measures for the improvement of the people."</p>

<p>Attention is invited to the fact that according to Figure C 26
the percentage of those found fit for military service in Germany
has diminished in recent years, but it is doubtful whether this is
caused by a general lowering of physique. It may be due to the
application of a higher standard in consequence of increased supply.
The distinct increase in height, in Germany as well as in many other
European countries, of those obliged to offer themselves for military
service speaks against deterioration in the average of physique.
Against the suggestion that with the increase in height may be
coupled a greater disposition to tuberculosis must be set the fact that
amongst the tall is found a percentage of fit higher than the average.</p>

<p>Abelsdorff remarks of Table C 27: "The results of recruiting
for the years 1907 and 1908 have been grouped according to
the size of the place of birth of the recruits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E10" id="Page_E10">[E10]</a></span></p>

<p>The average for the whole empire in 1907 is 54.9, in 1908 54.5,
fit in every 100 finally examined. The percentage of fitness has
diminished 0.4% from 1907 to 1908. The numbers for 1904, 1905 and
1906 are respectively 56.4, 56.3, and 55.9%.</p>

<p>Towns with over 1,000,000 inhabitants show the smallest
number of fit: 1907, 31.4%; 1908, 28.2%. The decline is 3.2%.
Compared with the figure for the whole empire it shows 23.5% less
fitness in 1907 and 26.3% in 1908.</p>

<p>For towns of 500,000 to 1,000,000 inhabitants the figures are
slightly better; they reach 39.9% in 1907 and 44.0% in 1908; an
improvement of 4.9% on the figures of the largest towns. The
other three classes, viz., towns with 200,000 to 500,000; 100,000 to
200,000 and 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, show comparatively little
variation in their figures for fitness for military service. They are
50.1% and 48.9%; 47.9 and 48.2%; 51.8 and 51.5%. The
differences between the two years are not material. With the towns
of from 200,000 to 500,000 and from 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants
there has been a decrease against an increase in those of from
100,000 to 200,000 inhabitants. But the figures for all three
classes remain behind the average figure for the empire and so do
those of all towns, they show 50.4 and 50.1%.</p>

<p>The most favourable results are yielded by the country districts.
Here there were fit in 1907 58%, in 1908 57.7%. A trifling decrease
is shown even here. The figures, however, are higher by 3.1% in
1907 and 3.2% in 1908 than the average for the empire. The conclusion
is that the fitness is highest in the smallest, and lowest in
the largest places.</p>

<p>Taking the average for the Empire as 100, those found fit from
country districts number 106, from towns 92, from towns of over
50,000 inhabitants 83, and from towns of over 100,000 only 80."</p>

<p>The tables showing the recruiting results amongst those qualified
for the one year voluntary service are particularly interesting.</p>

The figures are too optimistic because no account has been taken of
those who were found temporarily unfit. The Classical Schools

<p>It goes without saying that the schools are only responsible to
a lesser degree for this; we have to deal here with a serious symptom
of a bad constitution amongst the higher social grades which betrays
itself also in the dying out of the socially prominent families. How
badly their progeny comes off, in spite of the great care bestowed
on it, is illustrated in Table C 34. In two Munich Regiments the
percentage of fit among all those entitled to offer themselves for the
one year's service from the most varied parts of Germany was only,
according to Dieudonné, 21.6, 20.1, and 16.4.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_35"></a>C 35 &amp; 36</div>

<p>Great anxiety is justly caused by the increasing number of those
taken care of in public Lunatic Asylums. It remains doubtful to
what degree this may be due to the greater use made of asylums
and the decrease of the care of the mentally infirm in the family
home; the deterioration of the nervous system nevertheless remains
according to the general impression an incontestable fact. As a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E13" id="Page_E13">[E13]</a></span>
symptom of this may be interpreted the increasing <span class="undrln">number of suicides
in civilised countries</span>, demonstrated in Rüdin's Tables, C 35 and C 36,
showing the number of suicides in every one million of inhabitants.</p>

<p>More serious still than the frequency of mental and nervous
diseases is another phenomenon which demonstrates how unsatisfactory
is the constitutional condition of large circle of our population
of to-day.</p>

<p>This phenomenon which as yet has received much too little attention
is <span class="undrln">the large scale on which families die out</span>, at first in the
male line. Apparently (sufficient observations for control are not
available) those families which hold an eminent economical or social
position (aristocracy, old county families, etc., etc.) are mainly concerned.
Because exceptional endowment in one or more respects (intelligence,
talent, will power, etc.) is generally required to secure or to maintain a
leading position, and because such endowment is given to only a
small fraction of the population, but is inherited largely by the progeny,
this dying out of the leading families means a serious loss to the race.</p>

<p>The deficient fertility of the stock thus endowed results in a
lower average of mental capacity in the population generally, and
cannot in the long run be made up by the constant re-appearance
of distinguished men appearing as variations, the smallest number
of whom are "mutations."</p>

<p>The tendency among town families to die out appears to be
wide-spread. Professor S. Schott in Tables C 37-C 40 adds materially
to our knowledge on this point, Professor Schott makes the following
comment on his Tables:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"S. Schott. Old Mannheim families, 4 tables."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_38"></a>C 38</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Average number of children in each generation; the families
being grouped according to the number of generations they attained.</span>
The families of 1807 (original families) and their descendants were classed
into five groups, according to the number of generations they attained
in Mannheim. For each group is calculated the average number of
children within one generation&mdash;for each separate family as well as for
the entire family (<i>i.e.</i>, the total of all the separate families which have
sprung from the same "original family"). For instance: "Original
families" which have lasted into the third generation, 464; the separate
families show in the first generation, 464 families, 2,377 children; in the
second generation, 718 families, with 3,645 children; in the third generation,
754 families, with 2,454 children. Accordingly, the total
families show average numbers 5.1, 7.9, 5.3; the separate families,
5.1, 5.1, 3.3. All these averages are minimum figures, because it
was impossible to eliminate the moderate number of couples who
emigrated before the number of their offspring was completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E15" id="Page_E15">[E15]</a></span></p>

<p>In the generations up to the third inclusive, reproduction may
be considered as terminated, but in the fourth, and especially the
fifth and sixth, it still is in progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_39"></a>C 39</div>

<p class="undrln">Age intervals separating the various generations.</p>

<p>Taking into account all the families investigated, the average
length of time between the birth of the originator of the family and
his first born son was 33<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> years, his first born grandchild 63<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> years,
and his first born great grandchild 95<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> years. The curves become
gradually flatter, because the possible difference between minimum
and maximum age distance from one generation to another increases
in arithmetical progression.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_40"></a>C 40</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Prolificness of first marriages in the 19th century.</span> Taking the
entire period from 1811 to 1890 together the percentage of large
families (six children or more) and of small families (one-two
children) produced by all first marriages, excluding childless
ones, is indicated by the horizontal centreline. The positive or
negative deviations from the average during each decade are
entered respectively above and below this line. The note in Figure
C 38 referring to the families which may have emigrated while still
productive applies here also. The temporary increase in prolific
marriages after 1870 may be in connection with the material decrease
in the age of those contracting marriage for the first time, as compared
with the preceding decade. (Men 28.65 in the earlier period
as against 27.41 in the later, and women 25.92 against 24.68 years.)</p>

<p>The extinction of the families is undoubtedly due partly to other
causes than the voluntary limitation of families&mdash;to a process
of degeneration. A very remarkable proof of the degenerative
character of the dying out of families is given by Pontus Fahlbeck in
his book, "The Aristocracy of Sweden" (Fischer, Jena, 1903).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_41"></a>C 38-43</div>

<p>The six Figures C 38-43 give what is biologically of greatest
interest in it. Note how the terribly <span class="undrln">quick extinction</span> of the <span class="undrln">families</span>
of the nobility is <span class="undrln">inaugurated by catastrophic changes</span>: rapid fall in
the frequency of marriages, in the number of fertile marriages, and
in the number of their progeny. The curves of the surviving families
(red in the original tables) are for comparison. That
we have to deal here with a natural and not a voluntary process is
shown by the rapid increase in the mortality of male youth in the
last generations; also by the extraordinary change in the proportion
of the sexes of the children&mdash;which, of course, is beyond any control,
marked preponderance of girls amongst the survivors (possibly
also by the frequency of still-born male children).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E16" id="Page_E16">[E16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="undrln">A disturbance in the normal proportion of the sexes as a symptom
of abnormal germ production</span> may also assert itself in the opposite
direction. O. Lorenz has pointed out the frequent occurrence of an
extraordinary increase of male children immediately before the
extinction of a family in the male line. One of the most celebrated
of these cases is the one of the family of the Emperor Max II. He
had six sons and two daughters, who all reached the age of maturity,
but not a single male grandchild in the legitimate male line.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_44"></a>C 44</div>

<p>Fresh evidence is exhibited by von den Velden in Figure C 44.
With the families described by von Riffel, who have died out in the
male line, there is still a great preponderance of boys in the last
generation in which boys have reached the age of sexual maturity,
whereas there is a preponderance of females amongst the brothers
and sisters of the wives of the last male issue of the family.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2">Figure C 44.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_45"></a>C 45</div>

<p>In this connection another figure, C 45, by von den Velden ought
to be mentioned. He shows, from investigations made by von Riffel,
that the <span class="undrln">physical condition of childless couples is on the average
inferior to that of fertile parents</span>. This, however, by no means
holds good in every case. Evidence to the contrary is given by the
pedigree of an aristocratic family which has died out in the male
line. It may be looked upon as typical. One generation (the
second), with three times as many grown up men than women, produces
only four boys (44% of the children), of whom two reach
maturity. With the fourth generation the male issue dies out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E17" id="Page_E17">[E17]</a></span>
Though a large majority of the members of all three generations
(2-4th) have good health and attain to an exceptionally high age,
most of the female lines also die out. Only in two branches, which
spring from the marriage of an aristocratic daughter with a man from
the people, there are children in the fifth generation of whom at
least a part promise a healthy progeny. Fahlbeck, too, has drawn
attention to the fact that the dying out Swedish aristocracy shows
no signs of striking degeneracy in the individual.</p>

<p>This fact is of the greatest theoretical and practical importance
because it proves that there exists, up to a certain degree, an independent
degeneration of the germ plasm, even as the germ plasm may
remain unaffected by damage to the soma. That such a one-sided
degeneration of the germ plasm with respect to the power of
reproduction may take place among animals has been known for a
long time.</p>

<p>In particular, Chs. Darwin has collected facts of this kind in
his "Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication." For
civilised peoples it is a matter for reflection that with animals even
slight deviations from their customary "natural" mode of living
may lead to such serious consequences.</p>


<p class="caption3">RACE-HYGIENE.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_46"></a>C 46 &amp; 47</div>

<p>As the <span class="undrln">nature and aims of race-hygiene</span> are still unknown in wide
circles it will be useful to show in Tables C 46 and C 47, by A. Ploëtz,
what its position is amongst other sciences and what the various
branches of its activity consist in.</p>

<p>Many theoretical workers hold that the most important mission
or race-hygiene is to fight against Therapeutics and Hygiene of the
individual, for about these they have the most serious misgivings.
They consider, that by maintaining inferior variations up to the age
of reproduction, the average quality of the race must suffer and
that to certain defects&mdash;which otherwise would rapidly disappear&mdash;an
opportunity is given to spread through an entire people. This
point of view, short sighted as it may be, must be examined into.
It appears to be forgotten that on the one hand hygiene is powerless
in cases of a high degree of degeneration and that on the other hand
hygiene, by prevention of illness, does away with a number of
causes of inferiority. Finally it appears to be entirely overlooked
that with the best inherent qualities and unfavourable surroundings
the individual development may be poor and stunted. Of what use
are the highest potentialities if they remain latent? The main point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E18" id="Page_E18">[E18]</a></span>
is that so far convincing proofs of the preponderant harmfulness of
hygiene are entirely absent. (S. Gruber, Heredity, Selection and
Hygiene. Deutsche med. Wochenschr, 1909).</p>

<p class="caption2">Figure C 48.</p>

<p>Dr. Agnes Bluhm contributes to the question of the deterioration
of the race by therapeutic measures in dealing in <a href="#C_48">Figure C 48</a>
with "<span class="undrln">The increasing frequency of surgical operations in connection
with childbirth and its significance for the race.</span>" She writes in
explanation "The number of doctors having increased relatively
much more than the number of the population, it follows that for
a growing number of women medical assistance at childbirth is
available. To this must be added that progress in surgical
technique, above all the diminished danger of infection, allows of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E19" id="Page_E19">[E19]</a></span>
much more frequent operative interference with good results for
mother and child. Both these facts find expression in the reduction
of the number of stillbirths. The purpose of these operations being
to assist a diminished birth capacity in women, and this diminished
capacity arising partly from constitutional and consequently
hereditary factors, this question suggests itself: Is the average birth
capacity of women progressively diminished by the fact that an
increasing number of women, more or less unfit for childbirth, are
artificially assisted in bringing forth living children who inherit this
weakness from the mother?"</p>

<p>"Our table attempts to answer this question on the basis of
official Midwifery Statistics compiled in the Grand Duchy of Baden
reaching back to 1871, that is the beginning of the antiseptic era.</p>

<p>"To avoid the errors, which small figures might lead to, each
calculation has been based on the average figures of a lengthy
period. The material dealt with comprises over two million
births."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_48-1"></a>C 48-1</div>

<p>"<a href="#C_48">Figure 1</a> shows the <span class="undrln">increasing frequency of all childbirth
operations taken together</span>. The period 1871 to 1879 shows an
average of 4.38 operations to every 100 births, the period 1900 to
1907 up to 8.12 operations to every 100 births."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_48-2"></a>C 48-2</div>

<p>"<a href="#C_48">Figure 2</a> shows the <span class="undrln">frequency of each class of operation in
every 1,000 births</span>. Each class of operation shows an increase in
number, but the increase has not been uniform throughout the
various classes."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_48-3"></a>C 48-3</div>

<p>"<a href="#C_48">Figure A and B</a>, shows the <span class="undrln">share of each class of operation
in the total number for the various periods</span>. A more leading part
is taken by aftermath operations, by artificially induced premature
birth, by perforation of the head and by Caesarean section on the
living. Aftermath operations depend (like the use of the forceps)
to such a degree on the teachings of the various schools for midwifery
(and on the time at the doctor's disposal) that they can
hardly serve as a standard of birth capacity. The Caesarean
section, too, can hardly be taken as a guide, as a much wider view
is taken now of the indications for this operation. But the equally
increasing numbers of perforations of the head and artificially
induced premature birth are well worthy of attention. For these
two operations exclude one another. With the existing tendency to
avoid perforation of the head by artificially inducing premature
birth, a rise in the curve of premature births should correspond with
a sinking of the perforation curve. 1871 to 1879 a maximum of
the former actually coincides with a minimum of the latter; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E20" id="Page_E20">[E20]</a></span>
from there on both curves rise, though not in the same degree.
Premature births have become since then (see <a href="#C_48">Fig. 2</a>) more than
eight times as frequent; perforations of the head have trebled; and
dismemberments of the child have doubled. This fact must be
considered as a sign of lessened birth capacity."</p>

<p>"<a href="#C_48">Figure 5</a> gives the <span class="undrln">share which abnormal position of the child
has in this total</span>, and a comparison of the two shows that whilst the

2.35% in the case of stillbirth through abnormal position. The
conclusion is, that there is now more opportunity for hereditary
transmission of the tendency to faulty position of the child than
three to four decades ago."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_48-6"></a>C 48-6</div>

<p>"But <a href="#C_48">Figure 6</a> proves that up to now an <span class="undrln">increased inheritance
of this tendency has not taken place</span>. The curves of these positions
not only show irregularities but (with the exception of cross births) a
tendency to sink."</p>

<p>"Recapitulation. The growing frequency of surgically assisted
births cannot be taken as evidence of a diminished birth capacity,
but is closely connected with the growing number of doctors.
Against the indications of a diminished birth capacity stand at the
moment those which previously could be taken as pointing in the
opposite direction. It would, therefore, appear that medical interference
at birth has brought to the race advantages as to quantity
and no drawbacks as to quality. But it is probable that the picture
will change during the coming decades, because only then will the

<p>The great anxiety about the elimination of the severest struggle
for existence is based on the undoubtedly erroneous fundamental
conception that the organism is a sorry product of necessity which
can barely manage to maintain a laborious existence by the constant
straining of all its faculties, and that it requires the continuous use
of the whip of necessity to prevent an organism from giving way to
its inherent tendency to degeneration. In fact, however, no
organism is conceivable which has not the "Tendency" to maintain
itself and to react accordingly. There are many facts which
prove that a wealth of capacities and tendencies is dormant in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E21" id="Page_E21">[E21]</a></span>
organisms which for innumerable generations have not been active,
or, perhaps, have, never functioned in every possible way, and
that, therefore, if the occasion arises replacements or accommodations
of an unprecedented character may occur. In an unprejudiced
system of race-hygiene these facts must not be overlooked. The
exhibition in this section gives two specially striking instances; the
one from animal the other from plant life.</p>

<p><span class="undrln">Number of conceptions and conception losses</span>, by Dr. Agnes
Bluhm; the exhibitor gives the following explanation&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">Hamburger's material deals with 1,042 marriages of the labouring classes
in Berlin, with a total of 7,261 conceptions (an average of 6.97 conceptions
for each woman); the material of Bluhm comprises 856 marriages of the
wealthier and educated German middle and higher classes with a total of
3,856 conceptions (averaging 4.50 conceptions to each woman). Hamburger
has counted as conception losses only miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths,
or deaths from illness before the completion of the sixteenth year.
Bluhm has included all those up to the twentieth year. Both have only
included marriages which have been contracted at least twenty years back.
As the births in these marriages apparently date back to twenty years, all
living children are reckoned as survivors or conception results, even if they
have not attained the sixteenth or twentieth year respectively. This has influenced
the result optimistically, but as it has done so with both authors alike,
the comparison of their results is admissible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_52-1"></a>C 52-1</div>

<p class="blockquot">Figure 1 shows the <span class="undrln">conception losses in marriages of varying conception
numbers</span> (Curve A, Hamburger's working-men's families; Curve B, Bluhm's
well-to-do families); both curves confirm Hamburger's words that "the
percentage of the survivors gets smaller in proportion as the conception
number increases." The mounting of Curve B in the families with ten births
is probably a delusion brought about by a very small number. In the marriages
with eleven or more births there are lost with the well-to-do one
quarter and with the working-classes nearly two-thirds of the conceptions up
to the twentieth or sixteenth year respectively.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_52-2"></a>C 52-2</div>

<p class="blockquot">Figure 2 represents the <span class="undrln">share which miscarriages and premature births
have in the conception losses in marriages of different degrees of productiveness</span>
(Curve A, Hamburger; Curve B, Bluhm). Amongst the Berlin labouring
classes on the average 17.89 per cent. of all conceptions are lost through miscarriage
and premature birth; for the wealthier German families the figure
is 7.59 per cent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_52-3"></a>C 52-3</div>

<p class="blockquot">Figure 3 shows the <span class="undrln">share which deaths and stillbirths have in conception
losses</span>. With the labouring classes it amounts on the average to 32.75 per
cent. (Curve A), and in the wealthier families to 10.55 per cent. (Curve B).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_52-4"></a>C 52-4</div>

<p class="blockquot">Figure 4. To investigate whether the continuous decrease in the percentage
of the survivors, going hand in hand with the increase of maternal
conceptions, is caused by the constitutional inferiority of the offspring as the
numerical position increases, Bluhm has established, in dealing with her
material, the loss for each numerical position (first, second, third, etc., conceptions
respectively). If this were the case, Curve A, which gives the loss
according to the frequency of conception in each marriage, would have to be
identical with Curve B, which gives the loss of first, second, and third,
etc., conceptions, but this is by no means the case, for only at a very high
numerical position of the conception the curves begin to be parallel. This
proves that Hamburger's "the percentage of the survivors gets smaller in
proportion as the conception number increases" is not a biological law but
only expresses a social phenomenon. With the increasing number of children
there is a decrease in the value of each individual childlife. The mother
is less careful about avoiding miscarriages; she devotes, and must necessarily
devote, less care to each child; and the risk of infectious diseases which are
a frequent cause of death during infancy increases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_53"></a>C 53</div>

<p>How little the increasing mortality of the later born children
up to the tenth child is based on a biological law is shown in
Figure C 53. <span class="undrln">Numerical position of birth and infant mortality up

ninth children show the same mortality as the 614 first born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E24" id="Page_E24">[E24]</a></span></p>

<p>Pearson endeavored to prove a high degree of inferiority in
the first born, physically and intellectually as well as morally. But
his results are very open to attack, as Weinberg has recently shown;
one is reminded of Pearson's results in Crzellitzer's Figure C 54&mdash;first
and later born. Crzellitzer writes thus about this&mdash;"A <span class="undrln">high
degree of myopia</span> is <span class="undrln">more frequent amongst first born</span> than among
later children. The disadvantage of the first born in respect of
myopia is based on a greater hereditary taint and on no other
factor. Where there is no hereditary taint about one quarter to
one-third are affected, no matter whether first, second, third, etc.,
born. Also in well-to-do families, where the age of fathers at the
time of procreation is materially higher, the first born are more
frequently myopic than their brothers or sisters."</p>

<p>Figure C 55&mdash;<span class="undrln">influence of numerical position of birth on infant
mortality</span> and Figure C 56&mdash;<span class="undrln">mortality of the first and later born</span>.
Weinberg writes concerning these: "The parallelograms in the first
row indicate for each position in order of birth how many children
out of every hundred die before the age of 20. On this, however,
the difference in the mortality in families with different numbers of
children has an influence. To counteract this, it has been calculated
how many children in each position would die if within each
family the number of children had no influence, and the actual
number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the expectation
calculated in this way gives parallelograms to the second row.
After eliminating the influence exercised by the size of the family,
the increase of the mortality with the higher birth number appears
considerably smaller. Figure C 56, which compares the mortality of
the first and last born children, is to a certain extent a test of this.
This shows clearly a considerably higher death rate in the last born.
Both figures indicate that children of the same numerical position of
birth show a higher mortality, if from tuberculous families."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_57"></a>C 57</div>

<p>Of a materially greater influence than the numerical position of
birth or the number of children in each family is the length of
interval between births. We point at first to Figure C 57&mdash;<span class="undrln">interval
between births and child mortality</span>, after Ansell and Westergaard, by
Dr. A. Bluhm. She writes in reference to it: "Ansell has demonstrated,
from the material of the National Life Assurance Society of
London, that a child has an increasingly better chance to survive his
first year, the greater the interval between his own birth and that of
the child born before him. If this interval is less than a year, the
infant mortality is double what it is when there is an interval of two
years (15.75% against 7.33%). This influence makes itself felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E27" id="Page_E27">[E27]</a></span>
beyond the age of infancy up to five years but not in so striking a
manner. The proportion becomes modified to 20% against 12%. As
the influence of the birth interval on child mortality is still very
perceptible after the tenth or later children, it may be assumed
that it is not caused exclusively by the exhaustion of the maternal
organism produced by the rapid sequence of births. The varying
length of breast-feeding of the children has probably also its
influence. Though these statistics give no data about the mode of
infant feeding, it is nevertheless probable that in those families in
which there are longer intervals between consecutive births each
child is suckled for a longer period.</p>

<p><span class="undrln">Influence of the length of the birth interval and the duration of

writes regarding the latter table "in proportion to the length of the
interval between two births, the mortality of the children following
decreases materially, but this relation only becomes clearly apparent in
families in which several of the children have been suckled for more
than six months."</p>

<div class="sidenote">C 60, 61, 62</div>

<p>The intimate connection which exists between birth interval and
suckling and the great importance which suckling has under the
favourable influence of a long birth interval is shown in Dr. Agnes
Bluhm's Figures C 60, C 61, and C 62&mdash;<span class="undrln">infant nutrition (breast
feeding), number of children and infant mortality</span>, after Dr. Marie
Baum. "The material is taken from the towns of Gladbach,
Rheydt, Odenkirchen and, Rheindalen, and comprises 1,495, mostly
poor families, with 9,393 cases in which the mother survived childbirth
and 9,487 children born alive. In this table only 7,983
children were counted, because the remainder had not reached the
age of one year on the day of counting. Of these 7,983, there died
before the completion of the first year 1,276, or 15.98%."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_60"></a>C 60</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Number of children and child mortality</span>: Bluhm adds:&mdash;"Figure
1 shows in Curve A the <span class="undrln">influence of the duration of breast
feeding</span>; in Curve B <span class="undrln">influence of numerical position of birth on the
mortality of the infant</span>. The very divergent course of the two
curves expresses the very different influence of both these factors
on mortality; the latter is almost exclusively dependent upon
the length of suckling, and shows corresponding with its increase a
continuous and steep decline down to 1.46% from a maximum number
of 35%. The very slight increase of the mortality of children
suckled for six weeks compared with those who have not been breast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E28" id="Page_E28">[E28]</a></span>
fed at all is immaterial (35.55% against 35.28%). These figures
prove only that breast feeding up to six weeks does not give the
child any protection against fatal diseases. The influence of the
birth number hardly makes itself felt up to the seventh child, only
from the eighth onwards the power of resistance decreases continuously
but not nearly to the same degree in which it grows with
the length of breast-feeding (greatest difference only 21%). Curve
B shows a materially different course from that of similar curves
by other authors, for instance&mdash;from Geissler's well-known curve,
dealing with Saxon miners, in which not only the first born show up
less favourably than the second and third born, but in which, from
the fourth child on, the mortality increases rapidly. The economical
condition of both groups being similar (85% of Baum's families had
a maximum yearly income of £75), it is highly probable that the
difference in the curves arises from different methods of infant
feeding. In the Rhine provinces, as is also proved by Baum's
figures, the feeding is good; in Saxony, however, it is notoriously
bad. The co-relation of infant mortality with infant feeding is very
clearly illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, the former shows the
<span class="undrln">influence of the length of suckling on the mortality of the children
classed in order of birth</span>, the latter <span class="undrln">the influence of the order of
birth in connection with different lengthed periods of suckling</span>.
The extraordinarily regular course of all the nine curves in Figure
2 and the extremely irregular course of the six top curves in Figure 3
are very striking. From these figures it is shown that the first,
second and third born if breast-fed for a short time only, or not at
all, are subjected to much greater risks than the eighth, ninth, tenth
or later children, suckled for a sufficient length of time (maximum
difference 1 to 42). In the curve showing the children who were
breast fed for 39 weeks (Figure 3), the influence of the high birth
number shows only to a very small degree."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_61"></a>C 61</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Number of children and capacity for breast-feeding.</span> Concerning
this it is remarked: "The upper curve shows what percentage
of children had to do without breast feeding, and the lower one
how many enjoyed the sufficient period of 39 weeks of breast-feeding.
Though Baum's figures are only intended to deal with the
number of cases of breast feeding and not with its duration, and
though no difference is made between exclusive and partial breast
feeding, yet some conclusions may be drawn with regard to suckling
capacity. In a district where breast feeding is as general as it is in
the one examined into here, the number of women who voluntarily
renounce every attempt at suckling must necessarily be small. The
curve dealing with the children who had no breast feeding at all is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E29" id="Page_E29">[E29]</a></span>
therefore likely to give a fairly correct picture of the absolute or
primary incapacity for suckling on the mother's part; absolute
incapacity does not of course mean that the mother could not produce
a single drop of milk, but that she does not produce enough to
satisfy the child, and therefore must resort to artificial feeding. As
a period of 39 weeks' feeding, even if only partial, points to a good
capacity, the lower curve may also be taken as an expression of
feeding ability. A comparison of both figures illustrates that the
milk production after the first birth is smaller than after the following
ones, and that beyond the eighth birth, it decreases materially and
continuously, probably in consequence of the exhaustion of the
maternal organism."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_62"></a>C 62</div>

<p><span class="undrln">The habit of breast-feeding as running in families and infant
mortality.</span> With this goes the following explanation: "The two
figures illustrate the proportion of mortality of the infants in
143 bottle-feeding families and 376 breast-feeding families of the
first order. As the line could not be drawn very sharply,
and as in the bottle-feeding families there had to be included
those in which as an exception one or other child was suckled for a
few days or perhaps for a week, one can see in these groups only the
expression of the habit, but not the power of suckling. Both figures
illustrate the largely avoidable sacrifice in young lives which still
goes on through a want of knowledge and of feeling of responsibility
towards the coming race. With the absence of breast-feeding the
unfavourable influence of a very large number of children becomes
much more apparent; whereas in breast-feeding families the
difference in the mortality between medium-sized families (four to
six children) and very large families (above ten children) amounts
to only 1.39%, it reaches 12.90% with the non-suckling families.
Here, if the number of children surpasses ten, nearly every second
child dies in the suckling age, and amongst thirteen families there is
not a single one which has not lost a child in that period, whereas
in breast-feeding families of the first order, with the same large
number of children, only every thirteenth child died in infancy,
and of sixteen families seven (= 43.75%) lost no infant." The
same material is treated in a different way by Dr. Marie Baum, of
Dusseldorf, in Figures C 63-66.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_63"></a>C 63</div>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="undrln">As the length of the period of suckling of the preceding child increases,
there is a constant and rapid decrease in the number of children who are born
at intervals of less than one year.</span> If the preceding child was not breast-fed
a new birth occurred before the expiration of one year in 9.6 cases out of
100. With a suckling period of one-half to three-quarters of a year of the preceding
child, this figure is reduced to 1.8 per cent., and after a still longer suckling period
to 1 per cent. Out of one hundred mothers who have only partly or not at all suckled
the preceding child, seventy must count on a fresh birth within a period of 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E30" id="Page_E30">[E30]</a></span>
If the preceding child was suckled for at least 39 weeks, only thirty-eight,
and with a suckling period of more than a year only twenty mothers have
to reckon on a fresh birth within 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> years.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Figure C 65 enables us to examine into the <span class="undrln">influence exercised by a longer or
shorter interval after the preceding birth on the vitality of a child</span>, according
as to whether the child was not breast-fed at all or only moderately or
amply so. The black oblongs demonstrate that the average infant mortality
falls regularly and decisively according to the length of time between the
birth of the children considered and their predecessors. The average
mortality of infants who are born in rapid succession&mdash;under one year, one
to one and a quarter years, amounts to over 25 and to 22 per cent. respectively,
whereas the average mortality of children with at least two years'
interval amounts only to 11 per cent. "At the same time, however, it is
observed that the influence of the length of suckling is still greater than
that of the length of time elapsing between births. Even with an interval
of three or more years, the mortality of children who were insufficiently or
not at all breast-fed was above 20 per cent. The children who had been
suckled for at least three-quarters of a year were only very slightly
influenced by this factor in all groups, except that with a birth interval
of less than one year, where the influence of short birth intervals is not
counterbalanced even by long extended breast-feeding."</p>

birth interval of less than one year, one-third of the children die in the
first year, but only 7 per cent. where the average birth interval was over
three years; but here also the influence is strongly modified by the mode of
feeding. With the non-suckling families the mortality is almost 25 per cent.,
even with a birth interval of more than two years. On the other hand, when
the duration of suckling is sufficient, short birth intervals almost disappear
(see Table 2), and with an average birth interval of 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 2 years and a
suckling duration of at least half a year the mortality remains on an
extremely small scale."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_67"></a>C 67-73</div>

<p>Groth and Hahn have exhibited two large tables C 67 and C 68
and a similar one C 69, the results of their important investigations
about <span class="undrln">breast-feeding and mortality in the administrative districts of
Bavaria</span>. Groth shows in Table C 70 "<span class="undrln">mortality of sucklings in
Bavaria</span>," and in Table C 71 "<span class="undrln">breast-feeding and cancer</span>." In
Tables C 72 and C 73 the Groth and Hahn statistics are treated
by Dr. A. Bluhm from the point of view of the <span class="undrln">influence of the
habit of breast-feeding on the frequency of births</span>. In connection
with Figure C 73 she remarks: "This diagram shows the number of
bottle-fed babies in the various Bavarian districts counted at the time of
vaccination. To give as correct a picture as possible of the probable
influence which the habit of breast-feeding has on the birth-rate (annual
number of births per 1,000 of the whole population) there are represented
on this figure by green and yellow columns the average birth-rate
for the five years, 1875 to 1879, because in that period a record
birth-rate was established, so that it may be assumed that there was
then no intentional restriction of births. We see within the four 'old
Bavarian' districts, where on the average 64.1% of the babies were
not breast-fed at all, the number of births is about 4 per 1,000 of
the population higher than in the Palatinate and the three 'Frankish'
districts, which together only show 18% of non-breast-fed children."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E32" id="Page_E32">[E32]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_72"></a>C 72 &amp; 73</div>

<p>"These two figures deal with the <span class="undrln">influence of the length of
suckling on the birth-rate</span>, the longer the duration of the suckling
period, <i>i.e.</i>, the higher the number of children breast-fed for
six months or more, the lower the birth-rate. This only holds
good for the country (Curve B) not for towns (Curve A). This circumstance
is explained by the fact that the voluntary restriction of
births is much more frequent in towns than in the country, where
consequently the influence of the length of the period of suckling on
the birth frequency can find much stronger expression than in towns,
where, as Curve A shows, it is entirely extinguished by artificial birth
preventatives. From both tables it results that, to prevent the
senseless waste of human life, the interval between every two births
must be more than two years; further, that it is possible to increase it
by breast-feeding; the number of births in a district is based in the
main on the larger or smaller intervals at which the women of
reproductive age have children, and it may, therefore, at the
same time, be taken as an expression of these intervals. Keeping
these two facts in view, and considering the influence of the mode
of infant feeding on infant mortality, it appears to be in the interest
of the race that by means of the long duration of breast-feeding, the
birth intervals should be extended to at least two years. The facts
established in these two tables have a considerable bearing on race-hygiene,
especially in reference to the Neomalthusian contentions of
the necessary inferiority of the later born, and as a confirmation of
the utility of breast-feeding for the reduction of birth frequency.
Extremely great appears the influence of breast-feeding on infant
mortality."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_74"></a>C 74-78</div>

<p>This importance of breast-feeding is further illustrated by Figure
C 74&mdash;<span class="undrln">duration of breast-feeding and infant mortality</span>, after Dietrich;
by Figure C 75&mdash;<span class="undrln">average number of carious teeth</span>, after Bunge; and by
the three figures, C 76, 77, and 78&mdash;"<span class="undrln">average duration of breast-feeding
and physical development, duration of breast-feeding and
average school reports</span>, and <span class="undrln">duration of breast-feeding and frequency
of rachitic disturbances of development</span>," after the extensive and
valuable researches by Röse.</p>

<p>It must be pointed out that a far more direct connection exists
between breast-feeding, duration of suckling, infant mortality and
physical development than through the mere provision of suitable
nourishment for the child. A good suckling capacity is a symptom
of a strong constitution which is transmitted from mother to child.
Examination of Röse's table offers this suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="undrln">The importance of the hereditary constitution</span> (which he considers
is dependent on soil and climate) <span class="undrln">as regards infant mortality</span> v. Vogel
expresses in four maps of Bavaria (Figures 79-82), so which he has furnished
the following comments (contained in the pamphlet, "Der Örtliche
Stand der Säuglingsterblichkeit in Bayern," Munich, Piloty and Loehle,
1911): "The district of the highest infant mortality in Bavaria is
inhabited by a population of small height, small fitness for military
service, and high tuberculous mortality. The reverse holds good on
the whole for the district with a low mortality.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2">Figure C 79.</p>

<p>I cannot suppress another objection to the usual way of proving the&mdash;to
my mind undoubted&mdash;influence of breast-feeding on the duration
of life in infancy. Why is the mortality of those children who have not
been suckled for a week so large? Is it because they have not been
suckled, or because they have only lived altogether for less than a week?
Or, again, to be able to be suckled for 40 or 50 weeks, one must have
lived for 40 or 50 weeks, but a child who has lived for 40 or 50
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E34" id="Page_E34">[E34]</a></span>
weeks, whether it has been suckled or not, has passed over the worst
period. It is well-known that the mortality in the first days of
life is the highest in the second week, much higher than in the third
week, and so on. In short, the mortality changes in such an extremely
high degree in the course of the first year of life that this period
is much too long for the comparison between mortality of suckled
and non-suckled children. One ought to calculate how many of those
who have been suckled for 0 weeks, one week, two weeks, one month,
three months, six months, and so on, have survived the first week,
the second week, the first month, and so on. Only in this manner can
be established what is the share of the absence of breast-feeding and
what is the share of the innate weakness and tendency to disease in
the degree of infant mortality."</p>

<p>A striking peculiarity of cities, especially large cities, is, as pointed
out before, the high mortality amongst men; for this general observation
Figure C 83, <span class="undrln">male and female mortality in town and country</span>, offers an
example. Whereas the female mortality in Berlin, in the higher age
groups, is even lower than in Mecklenburg with its preponderantly country
population&mdash;which is evidence that in town life there are no inherent circumstances
adversely affecting all persons in a high degree&mdash;the male
mortality in all the age groups is higher, and in some much higher.
The special adverse influence on men of town life is also apparent in
the upper part of the figure (<span class="undrln">comparison of male and female mortality)</span>.
In Mecklenburg the mortality among men is at most 25%
higher than among women, and during the period of most intense child
production, as well as in the highest age group, it is even smaller,
whereas in Berlin the differences are much more accentuated. It
may be remarked that the higher male death-rate in Mecklenburg
between the ages of 40 to 75 years can only to a small degree be
explained by physiological reasons. This is shown for example by
the fact that in the provinces of Schleswig-Holstein, Pomerania,
Hanover, Hessen-Nassau, and the Rhein Provinces in the country,
the expectation of life for men aged 25 years is about equal to that
of women.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_84"></a>C 84 &amp; 85</div>

<p>The higher male mortality in cities is only partially explained by
the specific harmfulness peculiar to men's town occupations, though
the mortality of peasants and agricultural labourers ranks amongst
the lowest. A very important part in this connection may be
played by syphilis. How terribly syphilis injures the body, though
it is seldom directly fatal, is shown by the experiences of life insurance
companies, of which examples are given in Tables C 84 and C 85. With
the Gotha Life Insurance Bank, for instance, <span class="undrln">the mortality of the syphilitic
at the ages of 36 to 50 years</span> was found to be nearly double as high
(186%) as that of the non-syphilitic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_85"></a>C 85</div>

<p>Table C 85 shows to what a high degree <span class="undrln">the heart and vessels
especially are harmed by syphilis</span>. At this point it is to be noted that
it may now be considered as proved that the statement that general
paralysis causes death in 2.9% cases among the non-syphilitic is
erroneous, because general paralysis only occurs among persons who
have been affected with syphilis. There is no doubt that the poison
of syphilis is also most injurious to the germs and the progeny; the
f&#339;tus is sometimes infected in the mother's womb, and sometimes
suffers by the general debility of the maternal body. A large proportion
also of those children who attain a higher age are either enfeebled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E37" id="Page_E37">[E37]</a></span>
or damaged in many ways, and this inferiority is often passed down to
the grandchildren. The most recent Serum investigations (the Wasserman
reaction) are the first to throw full light on this. In Germany
syphilis occurs much more frequently in town than in the country;
this no doubt dependent on prostitution and on a much greater degree
of promiscuity of sexual intercourse in cities. In the country couples
keep together with greater constancy, even in the case of cohabitation
without marriage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_86"></a>C 86-88</div>

<p><span class="undrln">The frequency of syphilis and other venereal diseases in
town and country</span> is illustrated in Table C 86, which gives the
result of the enquiries of the Prussian Government on the 30th
April, 1900, and Table C 87 after Schwiening, on <span class="undrln">the frequency of
sexual diseases among military recruits</span>. Also Table C 88 which gives
the <span class="undrln">frequency of delirium tremens, epilepsy, and general paralysis</span> in
the <span class="undrln">Prussian lunatic asylums</span>, points in the same direction
by the great differences shown in the frequency of general
paralysis in the different institutions. This table, at the same
time, indicates what is also supported by other observations, that the
<span class="undrln">frequency and intensity of harmful influences through alcohol</span> are
much <span class="undrln">greater in towns than in the country</span>; this may be partly because
in cities there is a greater and more regular abuse of alcoholic beverages
than in the country, partly because town-life induces a greater
susceptibility to alcoholic poisoning than country life (less intense
metabolism with sedentary occupations).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_89"></a>C 89-90</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Injury to the reproductive function through alcohol</span>. It has
been known for a long time that drunkards are frequently sterile.
This must be attributed to the fact that the testicles of drunkards
become to a great extent atrophied. The condition is shown in
Figure C 89 by R. Weichselbaum,<a name="FNanchor_B_5" id="FNanchor_B_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_B_5" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> representing a section through
the testicle of a drunkard. Figure C 90 which shows a section
through a normal testicle, enables even the layman to observe the
atrophy of the characteristic glandular tissue of the testicle. Weichselbaum
has up to now found that in fifty-four cases, without exception,
in which alcoholism had been proved, this atrophy could be
demonstrated to a greater or less degree. In thirty of these cases
the subject was so young that senile atrophy was out of the question.
The abuse of alcohol is not the only harmful influence which is able
to induce such atrophy of the testicles, but chronic alcoholism acts
with special intensity. Very similar results to those of Weichselbaum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E38" id="Page_E38">[E38]</a></span>
have been obtained by Bertholet (Zentralbl. f. allg. Pathologie 20
Bd. 1909) in 37 out of 39 habitual drunkards. They agree with
observations on the vesiculae seminales of drunkards by Simmonds,
who found that in 61% of the cases examined the spermatozoa were
absent or dead. It is a permissible assumption that a poison which
can cause the total atrophy of the sexual glands may, in an earlier
stage, have adversely influenced in respect to quality the function
of those organs.</p>

<p>Bezzola has sent in in a modified form the data which he
presented to the Eighth International Congress against Alcoholism
in Vienna in 1901, on the <span class="undrln">effect of acute intoxication on the
origin of feeble-mindedness</span>. With their help the curve on
Figure C 97 has been constructed, showing the distribution of
illegitimate births in Switzerland during the different months of
the year from Bezzola's data and the corresponding curve of the
births of mentally eminent individuals (taken from Brockhaus'
encyclopædia.) The author supplies the following comments:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="undrln">Comparison between the general birth curve and the corresponding one for
the birth of feeble-minded children</span>."</p>

<p class="blockquot">The casual observation at the registration of the personal history of
feeble-minded individuals that 50 per cent. of the birth dates fall within
only fourteen weeks of the year (New Year, carnival, and wine harvest) has
aroused the desire to deal with the seasonal incidence of the begetting of the
feeble-minded on the basis of as much material as possible. For this purpose
the author's census of feeble-minded school children, which took place
in the year 1897, and referred to the years 1886-90 inclusive, seemed specially
suited. Originally (in 1901) a curve was plotted in which all the 8,186 feeble-minded
and idiotic children were included whose exact birthdays were known,
and this curve was compared with the total curve for that period. (Schweiz.
Statistik 112 Liefg.) The latter was constructed in the following manner
from the whole number of births (934,619) which occurred in these eleven
years:&mdash;The general daily average was taken as 100, and the daily average
for each month was expressed proportionately. Thus numbers above 100
show a daily birth frequency above the average, while for numbers below
100 the reverse is the case. The curve for the 8,136 feeble-minded persons
was constructed in a similar way, and thus a comparison with the general
population producing them was made possible. Subsequently (1910-11), in
order to secure homogeneous material, the first and last years were left out,
since by including them, owing to the non-agreement of the school year
and the astronomical year, the earlier months (January-April) were much
weighted. By this restriction of the material dealt with the number of
feeble-minded is reduced to 7,759, but the material for each separate year
is more homogeneous. Distributed between 2,922 days (eight years), the
daily production of the feeble-minded is 2.648, the corresponding total
number of births of the years 1882-89 ls 677,083, or 231.7 per day. 1.14 per
cent. of all births are included in the figure for the feeble-minded. If one
treats the total number of births for each month as well as the number of
births of feeble-minded according to the method described above, and used
by the Federal Statistical Bureau, two curves are produced which diverge
considerably from each other in particular months. On the whole the curve
for the feeble-minded (thick line) is flatter than the curve for the total.
Especially striking are the drop in May and June (corresponding to the procreation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E40" id="Page_E40">[E40]</a></span>
period from the 25th July to the 23rd September) and two peaks
rising above the "total" curve. One of these is slight, yet distinct. It
refers to the months of birth, July and August, corresponding with the
procreation period from the 24th September to the 24th November. More
conspicuous is the second peak of the curve for the feeble-minded from
October to December, otherwise a time poor in births. The centre of the
corresponding period of procreation (25th December to 26th March) is in
February (carnival). This seems to confirm the suspicion that during the
wine harvest and carnival an increased procreation of feeble-minded occurs
(procreation during drunkenness?).</p>

<p>We cannot suppress the remark that the fluctuations of the
curve for the feeble-minded are much too small to admit of the
drawing of an ætiological conclusion, but the fluctuations of the
intelligence curve and the illegitimate curve partly exceed the limits
of probable error. The peaks of both birth curves in February,
correspond to a peak in the procreation curve in May. Perhaps
one may attribute them to the existence of a remnant of a period of
"heat" (or a rutting season) in man.</p>

<p><span class="undrln">Lead.</span> Whereas the <span class="undrln">germ cells</span> are well protected against many
harmful influences from without which affect the soma of the mother,
they <span class="undrln">and the f&#339;tus produced from them suffer considerably from</span>
some. Amongst their deadliest enemies are <span class="undrln">certain poisons</span>, and
<span class="undrln">notorious in this respect is lead</span>. Table C 98 gives two sets of
statistics on this point, they justify the law in Germany, and in
other States, forbidding female labour to deal with lead and lead-containing
materials. Paul's figures, showing that lead poisoning
of the father is also extremely adverse to the production of a healthy
progeny, are remarkable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_99"></a>C 99</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Female Labour.</span> A baneful influence on reproduction is brought
to bear by the growing quantity of professional female labour away
from home and by the economic emancipation of women. Evidence
of this is given in Table C 99&mdash;"<span class="undrln">female labour and child
mortality</span>"&mdash;the data of which are taken from Prinzing's work.
Infant mortality is higher the larger the percentage of females
employed in factories during the child-bearing period. This is
partly due to interference with breast-feeding and partly to the
unfavourable influence on pregnancy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_100"></a>C 100</div>

<p>Dr. Agnes Bluhm has given in Figure C 100 "<span class="undrln">Female Labour
and Reproductive Activity</span>," the statistics of Roger and Thiraux, as
well as the results of the investigation of the Imperial Statistical
Office on the "Relationship of illness and deaths in the Local
Invalidity Fund for Leipzig and surroundings." Dr. Bluhm gives
the following explanation: "The top figure on the left is based on
material of the Local Invalidity Fund for Leipzig and surroundings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E41" id="Page_E41">[E41]</a></span>
dealing with over a quarter of a million of women of child-bearing
age. The distinction between obligatory and voluntary members
makes possible the estimate of the <span class="undrln">influence of work continued up
to the time of confinement</span>, because the voluntary members receive
the same weekly payments during confinement as the obligatory
ones, and, consequently, a woman has no object in joining the
voluntary insurance scheme except in order to secure rest before
confinement, which they procure for themselves at their own expense
and with the loss of their wages. (At that time the compulsory
support during time of pregnancy did not exist.) It is to be
noted that the voluntary members show ten times as many confinements
as the obligatory ones."</p>

<p>"The left hand figure at the top shows that the women who
work up to the time of confinement fall ill during their pregnancy
twice as often, and have six or seven times as many miscarriages and
premature births and 1.28 times as many cases of death in child-bed,
as those who stop work for a more or less extended period previous
to their delivery."</p>

<p>"The frequency of illness after childbirth is in both categories
of women almost the same; but the duration of the illness beyond
the period for which the legal subvention provides (13, 26, or 34
weeks respectively) is much greater in the case of the obligatory members
who do not spare themselves before their delivery."</p>

<p>"Left hand figure at the bottom&mdash;the researches were made by
Roger and Thiraux in a maternity home. A comparison is made
between the women who entered the home only at the beginning of
childbirth and those who entered during the last month of pregnancy
or sooner. Premature birth occurs in nearly one-third of the cases
among the former, but among the latter only one-eighth.</p>

<p>"Right hand figure at the bottom&mdash;dealing with the same
material as the left hand figure below compares the weight at birth
of the first, second and later born. The average weight of the
former is 300 g. and that of the latter 341 g. higher with mothers
who cease work two or three months before delivery, than with those
who worked up to the last. Possibly this expresses in the main the
different duration of pregnancy. The importance of the birth weight
of a child for its further development is not to be underrated."</p>

<p>"The top figure on the right shows that the importance of the
adverse influence of female labour on the race, shown in the above
figures, is growing, because there is an increase of employment
amongst married women. Simon's figures show that the manufacturing
industries, which in 1907 employed by themselves two million
female hands, the number of married women has increased by almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E42" id="Page_E42">[E42]</a></span>
200,000 during the last twelve years. In agriculture, in which four
and a half million females find their main occupation, the share of
the married women is much greater still."</p>

<p>"The increase of married female labour being intimately connected
with the development of our economic life, which cannot be
deliberately influenced, the demand for a Motherhood Insurance for
all female labourers of any kind, and for the extension of the legal
time of stoppage of work before childbirth to at least four weeks,
follows as a practical result of the facts stated above."</p>

<p>Dr. Bluhm's repeated assertion, which is regarded by many as
a dogma, that economic conditions cannot be deliberately influenced
(<span class="undrln">i.e</span>., that they are of the character of a law of nature) must not
remain uncontradicted as a principal. It is absolutely unproved,
though the difficulty of influencing our economic life cannot be
denied; the economic order has been created by man and <span class="undrln">must</span> be
altered if it proves harmful for the race.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_101"></a>C 101</div>

<p>The adverse influence of female labour on the progeny is shown
from a somewhat different point of view in Table C 101&mdash;"<span class="undrln">premature
births and abortions in different callings</span>." The most serious fact
shown here is that a low birth rate may frequently be found in
conjunction with a high rate for miscarriage and premature birth;
as the compiler of these statistics points out, this conjunction is most
apparent in those callings which demand frequent intercourse with
the public, such as domestic service, that is to say in cases where
pregnancy is particularly inconvenient. Probably in these cases
artificial prevention of pregnancy goes hand in hand with the
procuring of abortion!</p>

<p>Race-hygiene does not aim at an indiscriminate motherhood
insurance of married and unmarried mothers, but it aims at the
economic subvention and encouragement of legitimate fertility of
healthy and able parents, connected with, and rendered possible by,
a reduction of female labour away from the home. Marriage is one
of the most important hygienic institutions for the individual as well
as for the race, and it is folly to allow its decay and to replace it by
substitutes.</p>

<p><span class="undrln">The importance of marriage for the health to married persons</span>
is shown by figure C 102&mdash;"<span class="undrln">condition with regard to marriage
and mortality in Prussia, 1894-97</span>," as given in Prinzing's book.
That we have to deal here with an actual favourable influence of
marriage, and not with a selection of the healthy at the time of
marriage, is proved by the fact that the low death rate of the
married is maintained through all age classes and that the widowed
and divorced show throughout the highest death rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E43" id="Page_E43">[E43]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_103"></a>C 103</div>

<p>"<span class="undrln">Condition with regard to marriage and mortality, cases of
death from tuberculosis</span>," after Weinberg, also confirms with regard
to tuberculosis the favourable influence of marriage on the health
of men. With women the mortality from tuberculosis up to the age
of 60 is lowest among the unmarried. Pregnancy and suckling act
here adversely, but by far the worst position is also held here by
widows and divorced women.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_104"></a>C 104-105</div>

<p>The advantage of marriage for the progeny is made evident in
Figure C 104&mdash;"<span class="undrln">mortality of illegitimate children in different European
states</span>", and in Figure C 105 dealing with the "<span class="undrln">survival of the
legitimate and illegitimate children in Berlin in 1885</span>." After five
years there are still alive more than 60% of the legitimate, but only
40% of the illegitimate children. The higher mortality of the latter
is by no means a purifying process of weeding, but the expression
of greater sickliness which permanently harms the surviving also.
The division of labour between man and wife, with reference to the
care of the offspring, is one of Nature's institutions which is of the
greatest advantage for parents as well as children.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_106"></a>C 106-107</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Inbreeding and the Crossing of Races.</span> On the whole with mankind
inbreeding is viewed with fear, and justly so, in view of our
customary carelessness with regard to the physical and mental conditions
of those who contract marriage. <span class="undrln">If blood relations have
similar pathological conditions or pre-dispositions to illness or
degeneracy, the progeny which results from their union is endangered
to a particularly high degree.</span> Our collection brings as an example
of this in Table C 106&mdash;the pedigree of the celebrated Don
Carlos. The bad inheritance of Johanna the Mad asserts itself to a
lesser degree yet quite perceptibly also in the children of Max. II.
Table C 107&mdash;the children of Maximilian and his cousin Maria of
Spain; undoubtedly the Emperor Rudolf II. was mentally diseased.
Also Charles V. and his son Philip II. were abnormal characters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_108"></a>C 108</div>

<p><span class="undrln">Blood relationship of the parents and health of the children</span>,
which v. d. Velden has prepared from Riffel's family tables, also
speaks for the harmfulness of inbreeding. The offspring of blood
relations are emphatically weaker and sicklier than those of persons
related distantly or not at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_109"></a>C 109</div>

<p>The harm of inbreeding amongst the pathological is also illustrated
by the large Table 222 (exhibited by Schüle). Pedigrees from wine-growing
districts in the centre of Baden; against this it may be taken
as proved that inbreeding in itself between the healthy and fit
is not harmful. Animal breeders (as well as plant cultivators) make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E44" id="Page_E44">[E44]</a></span>
an extensive use of it with the view to the cultivation of certain hereditary
characteristics.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_110"></a>C 110</div>

<p>We show in Table C 110, after de Chapeaurouge, the <span class="undrln">pedigree
of Belvidere</span>, an animal which, in spite of close inbreeding, was
distinguished by excellent qualities, and by whom, out of his own
daughter, another sire of the highest rank was produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_111"></a>C 111</div>

<p>After long-continued and very close inbreeding, even with a faultless
condition of the germ plasm, the decrease of vitality and fertility
of the progeny asserts itself. Important evidence for this is given by
Georg. H. Shull in his exhibition of <span class="undrln">cross-fertilized, self-fertilized
and hybridized maize</span> (Exhibit No. C 111). Shull makes the
following comments: "Results of inbreeding with maize&mdash;crossing
between different races or genotypes, if not too distantly related,
results in a progeny which excels its parents in vitality, whereas
crosses between individuals belonging to the same genotype engender
no increase of vitality as compared with the parents."</p>

<p>In maize, and presumably in most other plants and animals
in which cross-fertilization is the rule, all individuals are usually
complicated hybrids between different varieties of genotype. They
owe their vigorous constitution to this hybrid nature.</p>

<p>"The result of self-fertilization or of close inbreeding is that
the hybrid nature diminishes in degree. The stock is reduced to a
homozygotic condition, and is thus deprived of the stimulus which
lies in the hybrid condition."</p>

<p>"When two given genotypes are crossed, the first hybrid generation
is possessed of the greatest vigour. Even the second generation
shows much less vitality, and this decrease continues with the third
and later generations. But each succeeding generation differs less
from its predecessor than the latter differed from its own parents.
As soon as the stock has become a pure line, inbreeding produces no
further weakening."</p>

<p>"The top row of the exhibited collection of maize cobs (large
cobs with many grains) is derived from a family in which for five
generations self-fertilization has been prevented by using mixed
pollen. These conditions approach those prevailing in an ordinary
field."</p>

<p>"The middle row of maize cobs (small cobs with few grains)
comes from families of the same derivation as the first row; but for
five generations they have been self-fertilized. Each one has characters
which the others do not possess. They are almost pure bred,
and continued self-fertilization produces no further adverse influence.
The cob, quite to the right, without grains, has pistils so short that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E45" id="Page_E45">[E45]</a></span>
they do not project from the husks. This genotype must, therefore,
be fertilized artificially."</p>

<p>"The lowest row (the largest cobs with the most grains) comes
from families which have been created by the crossing of plants
belonging to different genotypes, the relationship in which case is
indicated by the lines which connect this row with the middle row."</p>

<p>"The following harvests of grain were made in the year 1910:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_112"></a>C 112-114</div>

<p>It is well-known to what degree <span class="undrln">inbreeding</span> is practised in <span class="undrln">reigning
families</span>. We show as an example for this, Chart C 112, the
<span class="undrln">pedigree of the Archduchess Maria de los Dolores of Tuscany</span>, exhibited
by Dr. Stephan Kekule von Stradonitz, and Chart C 113 of
the same exhibitor, <span class="undrln">pedigree of Ptolemäus X</span>. Soter II. (Lathros),
and Chart C 114, <span class="undrln">pedigree of the celebrated Cleopatra</span>. Though with
Ptolemäus X. the effect of sexual reproduction in bringing about new
combinations of hereditary units was very limited, since the couple,
Ptolemäus V. Epiphanes and Cleopatra Syra having produced all the
germ cells from which he developed, he appears, nevertheless, to have
been a perfectly normal being. In his granddaughter Cleopatra
certainly much "extraneous blood" circulated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_115"></a>C 115</div>

<p>Even where there is no high degree of inbreeding, the individuals
of a people are much more closely related to each other than is
generally assumed. Table C 115, "<span class="undrln">theoretical number of ancestors</span>,"
shows that, assuming the duration of one generation to be 35 years,
and that no marriages between relations have taken place, the number
of the ancestors of a man living now would have been eighteen
billions in the year 0 <span class="smcap">a.d</span>. In reality the germanic race, wandering
west, probably only numbered hundreds of thousands. This phenomenon
of "<span class="undrln">ancestral loss</span>," as Ottokar Lorenz calls it (that the
number of real ancestors is much smaller than those theoretically possible),
can be illustrated in the pedigrees of the reigning houses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_116"></a>C 116</div>

<p>We have in Table C 116 an <span class="undrln">analysis of pedigree of Emperor
William II.</span>, after Ottokar Lorenz. Investigations show that twelve
generations back the real number of his ancestors amounts to only
one-eighth of the possible figure. Only 275 persons have actually
been found because in the older lines, the bourgeois element, of which
no record can be found, has had a very large share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E46" id="Page_E46">[E46]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_117"></a>C 117</div>

<p>Very little knowledge exists concerning the effect of the crossing
of races in man. On the whole it appears not to be favourable,
if it is a question of crossing of races from far apart, even in purely
physical respects. An example of harmful influence is given in
v. d. Velden's Table C 117&mdash;"<span class="undrln">Fertility and Health in relation to
the crossings of races</span>."</p>


<p class="caption2"><a name="NEOMALTHUSIANISM" id="NEOMALTHUSIANISM">NEOMALTHUSIANISM.</a></p>


<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_118"></a>C 118-122</div>

<p>The next and the greatest concern of race-hygiene&mdash;much greater
than the relative increase of inferiority&mdash;is, to-day, neomalthusianism,
the intentional restriction of the number of births in varying degrees
up to complete unproductiveness. Though conscious regulation of
the production of children is absolutely necessary, it becomes fatal
to a nation if under no control but the egotism of the individual. For
its permanent prosperity a nation requires, in order merely to hold
its own, a sufficient number of "hands" and a sufficient number of
"heads" to guide those "hands." We referred to this when mention
was made of sterility as a phenomenon of degeneration, but this
cause of sterility during the last decades only takes a second place
compared to deliberate intention. The wealthy and higher social
classes were first attacked by neomalthusianism. Their progeny is
becoming more and more utterly insufficient, so that under our present
social conditions, particularly which give mind and talent better openings,
and thereby more and more take out of the mass of the people
the better elements, make the strongest demand for them and use them
up, the danger of an increasing deterioration of the average quality
of its progeny grows greater and greater. The baneful influence of
wealth on fertility is shown by several tables. Figure C 118 "<span class="undrln">Fertility
and Wealth</span>," after Goldstein and Tallquist, gives the condition
in the French Departments; Figure C 119, "<span class="undrln">Number of Children and
Wealth</span>," after Bertillon, for the Arrondissements of Paris; Figure
C 120, "<span class="undrln">Fertility and Wealth</span>," after Mombert, for Münich, 1901,
Table C 121, "<span class="undrln">The Number of Children in Families of Different
Classes in Denmark</span>, 1901," after Westergaard; Table C 122, "<span class="undrln">Fertility
of Marriages, Occupation, and Wealth for Copenhagen, and
Dutch Conditions</span>," after Rubin, Westergaard, and Verrijn Stuart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_123"></a>C 123</div>

<p>The worst condition with regard to the fertility prevails among
those with the highest mental endowment. Evidence of this is given
in Figure C 123, "<span class="undrln">Insufficient Fertility of the Highly Endowed in
Holland</span>," after J. R. Steinmetz. It shows the rapidity with which
the number of children decreases. In order to estimate the significance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E47" id="Page_E47">[E47]</a></span>
of these statistics, it must be noted that after taking into account
the mortality among children and young persons, and the unfitness
for parenthood of an appreciable fraction of the adults, a
fully capable couple would have to produce at least four children to
assure the necessary moderate increase in the population which is
required to prevent a people from sinking into stagnation and
deterioration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_124"></a>C 124</div>

<p>The dying out of highly gifted families is shown to be more
accentuated in Figure 255, after Bertillon, "<span class="undrln">Progeny of the Highly
Gifted in France</span>." Four hundred and forty-five of the best
known Frenchmen, with their wives, have not even reproduced that
number of individuals, and this in spite of the fact that repeated
marriages of the same individuals have not been taken into account.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_125"></a>C 125-126</div>

<p>Even if one has been able, up to the present, to live in the hope
that the number of persons of more than average ability produced by
the mass of the people is always sufficient to replace those that are
used up, at the present time anxiety about the "heads" is replaced
by anxiety about the "hands." The knowledge of means of preventing
fertilization spreads incessantly, and is recklessly promulgated
by the neomalthusians and by a shameless industry. We
point to Figure C 125, "<span class="undrln">Want of Fertility in French Towns</span>," after
Jayle, and to Figure C 126, "<span class="undrln">Fertility in Prussia</span>." In Berlin fertility
is decreasing most rapidly; at the end of the sixties it still
amounted to 200 in every 1,000 women of child-bearing age. In the
five years, 1905-1910, only to 84; in the year 1910 only to 74. This
state of things is shown also in the relative increase in numbers of
the first born.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="C_127"></a>C 127, 128 &amp; 129</div>

<p class="pmb2">Figure C 127, "<span class="undrln">Decrease of Legitimate Fertility in Berlin&mdash;the
two-children system</span>." The other German towns follow the example
of Berlin. Berlin to-day produces 20% less children than are
required to maintain its own population without immigration, and
the same conditions will soon prevail in other towns. Up to now the
country districts in general maintain their fertility (West Prussia on
Figure C 128), but there, too, modern practices begin to make themselves
felt. The town and industrial population increases so rapidly
that the conditions prevailing among them have an ever increasing
effect on the people as a whole. Thus we see, even at the present
time, a serious decline in fertility among an overwhelming majority of
European States: Figure C 129, "<span class="undrln">Decrease of Fertility in Some
European States</span>."</p>

<p class="center">Explanation of Symbols used in the Charts.</p>

<p>Male individuals are indicated by squares and females by circles.
The members of each fraternity are connected by the same horizontal
line. The fraternity line is connected by a vertical line to the line
joining the symbols representing the father and mother. Illegal
unions and illegitimate children are shown by dotted lines. As an
aid in tracing the patient's immediate family, a green line is used
to connect the direct ancestors on the paternal side, and a red line on
the maternal side. The red squares and circles indicate epileptics, the
green the insane, the black the feeble-minded, and purple the
criminalistic. The figures directly above the fraternity line indicate
the rank in birth, a figure inside a square or circle shows the number
of individuals of that sex. A black dot suspended from the fraternity
line stands for a miscarriage or a stillbirth. A line underneath a
square or circle shows that institutional care has been received. The
hand points out our patient.</p>

<p>The following letters indicate the different conditions: A, alcoholic;
B, blind; C, criminalistic; D, deaf; E, epileptic; F, feeble-minded;
I, insane; M, migrainous; N, normal; P, paralytic; S,
syphilitic; T, tubercular; W, wanderer, tramp; d, died; b, born;
inf, infancy; Sx, unchaste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_1"></a>D 1</div>

<p>This chart shows very clearly the dangerous results of a marriage
in which both of the <span class="undrln">parents are epileptic</span>. Of the four children
the first three were epileptic, and the fourth, a boy, who died at
the age of nine, was feeble-minded. All four of these children were
cared for at public expense, two are patients at the New Jersey State
Village for Epileptics, and the other two were wards of the
Children's Home Finding Society. The epileptic father is dead, and
the mother married again to an alcoholic man. When last heard of
she had another child.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_2"></a>D 2</div>

<p>An <span class="undrln">epileptic</span> woman, married to a <span class="undrln">feeble-minded man</span>, is responsible
for the large number of defectives shown on this chart. The
principal mating is that of one of the epileptic daughters of this
woman, who, like her mother, married a feeble-minded man. Eight
children resulted from this marriage; one died before two years of
age, the other seven were epileptic, the five who are living are patients
at the New Jersey State Village. Two of the girls in this fraternity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E49" id="Page_E49">[E49]</a></span>
had illegitimate children before receiving proper care. This family
is undoubtedly a branch of a family of defectives, most of whom live
in an adjoining State.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_3"></a>D 3</div>

<p>This is a case of <span class="undrln">incest</span>, and shows plainly that the "empty germ
plasm can yield only emptiness." These people lived in a hut in the
woods. The feeble-minded man had by his defective sister an
epileptic daughter, then by this daughter he had four children, one an
epileptic, one a feeble-minded woman of the streets, who spends much
of her time in jail, one an anencephalic monster who died soon after
birth, and one a feeble-minded boy, who did not grow to manhood.
Since the hut in the woods burned down, the epileptic woman and
feeble-minded daughter live in a cellar in town, though much of their
time is spent in jail.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_4"></a>D 4</div>

<p>This chart shows a <span class="undrln">feeble-minded</span> man, who came from a feeble-minded
family, married to an <span class="undrln">epileptic</span> woman, who descended from
a tubercular epileptic father and a mother who is described as
"flighty," "not too bright." This couple had six children, three
feeble-minded, two epileptic, and one still-born. Since the death of
the epileptic mother, the father has secured homes in institutions for
all of his children except one, and then married again. As yet he
has no children by the second wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_5"></a>D 5</div>

<p>The wife in the central mating in this case is a low grade
<span class="undrln">epileptic</span>, who can scarcely recognize her own children. The father is
a <span class="undrln">feeble-minded alcoholic</span>, who works hard, but who spends all his
money for drink. There were six children; one died at the age
of four, and all of the others except one six-year-old boy are epileptic.
All are being cared for by the public. Before the mother and three
of the epileptic children were brought to the State Village for
Epileptics the family lived in a cellar, slept on rags, and depended
on the neighbours for food.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_6"></a>D 6</div>

<p>This is a history which illustrates very well the source of a large
number of the almshouse inmates. The central figure is an <span class="undrln">epileptic</span>
woman, who spent most of her life in the poor house. No two of
her seven children are by the same father. The epileptic daughter,
whose father was feeble-minded, had started to lead the same kind of
life as her mother; in the almshouse she gave birth to one illegitimate
child before she was put under State care. The mother, when she
last left the almshouse, went to live in a hut in the woods with a
feeble-minded man, who had three feeble-minded sons; one of these
sons married the feeble-minded sister of one of the epileptic patients
at the New Jersey State Village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E50" id="Page_E50">[E50]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_7"></a>D 7a</div>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_7b"></a>D 7b</div>

<p>This is the history of two patients who have been found to be
related, the great grandfather of the one was the brother of the grandmother
of the other. The principal mating under D 7a is that of a
<span class="undrln">feeble-minded</span> man married to an <span class="undrln">epileptic</span> woman, whose mother died
in the insane asylum. They had six children, the first died when only
a few months old, the next and the fourth were not bright and died
young, the third is an epileptic, the fifth is feeble-minded and
criminalistic and he is now at the State Home for Boys, the sixth
is also feeble-minded and cared for at an industrial home for children.
The mother and father, at one time inmates of the almshouse, are now
supported by the town. Under D 7b the father, who died of spinal
meningitis, was migrainous and had many epileptic relatives, the
mother is neurotic. There were four children, the first an epileptic,
the second died at 20 of spinal meningitis, the third is of a very
nervous temperament, the last, a girl of 16, seems to be normal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_8"></a>D 8</div>

<p>Both of the parents in this case are <span class="undrln">feeble-minded</span>. The father
was the black sheep of his family, his brothers are intelligent men,
and for the most part good citizens; the mother, however, was the
illegitimate child of a feeble-minded woman. There were seven
children, one an epileptic, the others all feeble-minded with the
exception of the sixth, who is now about 11 years old; she was taken
from her home and put with a very good family; she shows the effect
of the changed environment, and though not up to her grade in
school, is only slightly backward. There is some doubt about the
parentage of the child, and it is very probable that she is by a
different father. Since the father's death the mother has had one
illegitimate child; her children were taken away from her except
the two oldest because of the immoral conditions in the home, and
she now claims to be married to a feeble-minded man, who is the
younger feeble-minded brother of her imbecile daughter's husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_9"></a>D 9</div>

<p>The central mating in this case is that of an <span class="undrln">epileptic, alcoholic,
sexually immoral</span> man, married to a <span class="undrln">neurotic and sexually immoral</span>
woman, who has many insane and feeble-minded relatives. They
had in all ten children; two were epileptic, three, feeble-minded, one
criminalistic and sexually immoral, the sixth is the only one who has
a good reputation, the last was a stillbirth. The father and mother
are no longer living together.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_10"></a>D 10</div>

<p>The case illustrated on this chart is of a <span class="undrln">feeble-minded</span> woman
married to an <span class="undrln">alcoholic</span> man. The wife descended from an alcoholic
father, who had several epileptic relatives. The husband also
descended from an alcoholic father, and had an epileptic nephew.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E51" id="Page_E51">[E51]</a></span>
Of their nine children, the first three died young of scarlet fever, the
fourth was epileptic, and the other five are feeble-minded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_11"></a>D 11</div>

<p>On this chart we have the history of an <span class="undrln">epileptic</span> man whose
attacks were of the petit-mal type. He married a choreic woman.
They had four children, the eldest a man who developed epilepsy
after his second marriage. His first wife was insane; by her he had
two daughters, one of whom is now an inmate in an insane asylum,
the other is neurotic and has been treated in a sanatorium. Of the
other children two are apparently normal and one migrainous.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_12"></a>D 12</div>

<p>This chart shows an <span class="undrln">epileptic</span> man married to a normal woman;
he had both epileptic and insane relatives, while she had epileptic,
alcoholic, and tubercular relatives. Their first child was an epileptic,
the next were twins, one of these appears to be normal while the other
is of a very nervous temperament, the fourth died in infancy, and the
last three were stillbirths. The mother married the second time, this
time to a man who drank to excess after their marriage; by him she
had two children, both of whom seem to be normal. They are both
in school.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_13"></a>D 13</div>

<p>This is the history of a low grade <span class="undrln">epileptic</span>. His oldest sister
is normal; she was brought up by strangers after her mother's death,
and is now earning her living as a saleslady. The second was a boy,
who was thought to be normal until he was about sixteen, when he
displayed criminalistic tendencies, and for the crime of rape was put
in the Reform School. The youngest is a girl, who is of a very
nervous temperament. The father was an alcoholic, and went on
long sprees; he deserted his wife and family to live with a woman
who also deserted a family. His brother is an alcoholic, and married
the patient's mother's sister; they are now divorced. The
mother was migrainous, she died of tuberculosis; her family shows a
neurotic taint, while the father has several epileptic relatives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_14"></a>D 14</div>

<p>In the central mating the father and mother are both <span class="undrln">migrainous</span>.
They both belong to families prominent in the community in which
they reside; their homes are among the best, and they are counted
as leading citizens. There were nine children; three died before four
years of age, one is epileptic, one seems to be normal, and the others
all show some nervous taint, though not migrainous.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="D_15"></a>D 15</div>

<p>This is the history of a <span class="undrln">syphilitic and a sexually immoral couple</span>.
They were never married, and the woman for many years supported

RECORDS.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Exhibited by Dr. Raymond Pearl,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Biologist of the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, Orono,
Maine.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This exhibit consists of a series of blank record forms designed
to <span class="undrln">illustrate the method of keeping pedigree records</span> which has been
in use at the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station for a period of
five years, in connection with its work in the experimental study of
inheritance in poultry and in various plants. The advantages which
have been found by experience to inhere in this system of pedigree
record keeping are (<i>a</i>) simplicity; (<i>b</i>) ease of operation; (<i>c</i>) small
chance for error in the keeping of large masses of pedigree records;
(<i>d</i>) uniformity of the system, such that records of all kinds, in any
way pertaining to the work, may be brought together with great ease
for consultation or study.</p>

<p>In addition to the record blanks there are exhibited also various
marking devices and other apparatus connected with the proper
working of the plan.</p>

<p>It should be noted that while the blanks here exhibited are
devised particularly for work with poultry and plants, the same
system, with slight modifications, may be successfully applied to the
keeping of human pedigree records; indeed it is a pleasure to state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E55" id="Page_E55">[E55]</a></span>
that the system here exhibited is an outgrowth and development of a
scheme for the keeping of pedigree data in general and particularly
human pedigree records suggested many years ago by the late Sir
Francis Galton.</p>

<p class="caption2 smcap">The Racial Form of Nose and Its
Segregative Inheritance.</p>

<p class="caption2">By <span class="smcap">Geo. P. Mudge</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="undrln">form of a nose</span> doubtless depends upon many factors. But
chief among them we may suppose are the length, breadth, and
angle of inclination of the nasal bones; the form, length, breadth,
and thickness of the nasal septum, and the degree of development
of the turbinal bones. The segregation and persistence in families
of a definite type of nose-form is a subject well worth further study.
The inheritance of this character from the Mendelian standpoint has
not yet been adequately studied. But as with eye-colour, so with
nose-form, we desire to know not only how alternative characters are
inherited among individuals of the same race, but how they are
<span class="undrln">transmitted among</span> the offspring of mixed races.</p>


<p class="caption3">ENGLISH V. GIPSY.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="K_1"></a>K 1</div>

<p>I am able in the photograph exhibited to show what appears
to be an undoubted transmission of a very prominent form of nose
from a grandmother to a grandson. The grandmother (on the right
of the photograph, who is now over 80 years of age) was the wife
of a gipsy and she herself came of gipsy stock. She and her
husband eventually settled in a small village in the West of
England. They had six children, namely, two sons and four
daughters. Of the two sons, one was fair in complexion and had
the "wild ways and habits of the gipsy." The other was dark in
complexion and married an English countrywoman of the district
in which his parents had settled. She was of fair complexion.
They are shown, as husband and wife, in the left-hand corner of the
central photograph. They have had four children, namely, three girls
(shown in the centre of the photograph) and one son (shown standing
by the right of his gipsy grandmother in the right corner of the
photograph).</p>

<p>The gipsy grandmother has a very prominent type of nose. It
is characterised by three chief features: First, the broad base on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E61" id="Page_E61">[E61]</a></span>
which the external narial apertures are lodged; second, the marked
convexity of the contour of the bridge; third, the well-defined or
sharp angularity of the general form. Her son's nose differs from
hers in all three of these points. His wife's nose is of the more
rounded type and differs very widely from that of the gipsy grandmother
(her mother-in-law). The three girl children of these two
parents clearly do not possess a nose like that of their grandmother.
The two younger daughters appear to resemble their mother, while
the oldest appears to be an intermediate between her mother and
father. So far then there is no feature of any special interest.</p>

<p>But it is otherwise when we come to deal with the nose of the
son (grandson of the old gipsy woman). For it resembles hers in
all three of the marked features which give to her nose its distinctive
and prominent form. The convexity of the bridge is, perhaps, not
quite so pronounced, but then he is still young, and this is a feature
likely to become accentuated with age.</p>

<p>Two features of Mendelian interest are shown in this group
of a grandmother, two parents and four grandchildren. First,
there is a hereditary transmission of nose type from grandmother to
grandson. Second, there is a clean segregation of the nose type
manifested by the brother, from the contrasted nose type or types
exemplified by his three sisters. In addition, the case is interesting
since it manifests segregation of characters in the offspring of parents
of different races, <i>i.e.</i>, a gipsy and a native of the West of England.</p>

<p>In the absence of precise information concerning the form of
nose of the gipsy grandmother's husband, and of their five other
children, and of the brothers and sisters of the grandmother, it is
difficult to formulate a scheme showing a definite Mendelian inheritance
in this case. But the two features alluded to in the preceding
paragraph are strongly suggestive of inheritance according to
Mendelian principles.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mrs. Rose Haig Thomas for the general facts
of this case and for the photograph of the group.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="undrln">EUROPEAN V. AMERICAN RED INDIAN.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="K_2"></a>K 2</div>

<p>A few years ago I had an opportunity of meeting two friends
who had spent many years in different parts of Canada and were
acquainted with families who were derived from an ancestry partly
European and partly North American Indian. I gathered from my
friends, in virtue of much kindness and patience upon their part,
some valuable facts concerning the nature of various facial features
in the offspring of the two mixed races&mdash;European and Red Indian.
I purpose here to deal with two families and with only one character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E62" id="Page_E62">[E62]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i>, the type of nose. The Red Indian and European type of nose
are easily distinguishable. In the Red Indian the nose is prominent
and its frontal profile is formed by two lines which diverge from
the bridge towards the base. The latter is, in consequence, very
broad. The form of nose is sometimes known as the <i>busqué</i> or
curved type, since its lateral profile is in outline markedly aquiline.
But examination of a series of photographs of Red Indians shows
some variation in the lateral profile, since some are decidedly concave.
But the broadness at the base is apparently never diminished;
it is always marked and unmistakable. The well-pronounced Indian
nose can always be easily distinguished from the European nose by
persons who have had a long acquaintance with both races. But
cases do occur where even an experienced observer would feel some
doubt in expressing an opinion as to which type a given nose
belonged. Such cases are, however, not common.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="K_2a"></a>K 2a</div>

<p>From the pedigrees of families derived from a mixed racial
parentage in my possession, I select two for exhibition at this
Congress. The first is that known as "Family 5" in my list. In
this case a Scotchman (Generation A, S) married a full-blood
Indian woman. They had a son and daughter (Generation B, 2
and 3). The half-breed son had the Indian type of nose. The
daughter had a small and well-shaped European nose.</p>

<p>The son married a full-blood Indian woman (Generation B, 1)
and had four children. Two of these were infants at the time my
informant knew them, and though they were described as being
generally of the Indian type, they were too young to give any reliable
details concerning the form of the nose. The two elder children
(Generation C, 1 and 2) were a daughter and a son, and both had
the Indian type of nose.</p>

<p>The half-breed daughter (Generation B, 4) married twice. Her
first husband was a half-breed Indian (B 3). He was not seen by
my informant. They had a son and a daughter (Generation C, 5
and 6). The former was Indian in type of nose as well as in other
facial characters. The daughter, though she had very decided
Indian cheek bones, had the European type of nose. She is of
further interest, inasmuch as while her eye-colour was European
the shape of her eyes was characteristically Indian.</p>

<p>The second husband of the half-breed daughter was a Welshman
(Generation B, W). By him she had seven children. The last
was a baby at the time my informant saw it, and we may leave it out
of account. The penultimate child was a son (Generation C, 12),
and his nose was sunken, and my informant found it difficult to say
whether it was European or Indian in type. I rather suspect from
an inspection of some photographs of Indians which I have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E63" id="Page_E63">[E63]</a></span>
that it resembles a very concave flattened Indian type. Of the
remaining five children, four had an European type and one an
Indian type of nose.</p>

<p>Assuming that my informant's observations and memory are
accurate&mdash;and I feel sure they are quite reliable since he spent many
years among the Indians and half-breeds of North America in company
with other Europeans, and he is a man of naturally sharp
discernment&mdash;this family shows clear evidence of the segregation of
nose type. It is shown more particularly in the children of the half-breed
daughter who married twice, since among her offspring
(Generation C, 5-13) both types of nose appeared. The re-appearance
of the European nose was manifested, not only when she was mated
back to an European in her second marriage, but when she married
a half-breed like herself. This latter marriage, however, did not
constitute, as we might at first sight regard it, an experimental mating
in every way analogous to a Mendelian cross of DR x DR; because
although she was a half-breed her nose was not like her brother's
of the Indian type, but European.</p>

<p>It thus appears as though the Indian nose was dominant in one
case, and the European in the other. Too much stress must not be
laid on this point. So many half-breeds are indistinguishable from
full-blood Indians, that the possibility is to be borne in mind that
this woman's mother, who was married to the Scotchman, was not
really a full-blood Indian, and that tradition was in error. I am,
however, making further inquiries.</p>

<p>But Mendelian segregation is shown in this pedigree in another
way. The granddaughter (Generation C, 6), by the first husband,
manifested, as already indicated, an European type of nose and
European eye-colour. She also manifested other European characters,
with which I do not now purpose dealing. But her cheek bones were
decidedly Indian and the shape of her eyes were also Indian. Thus
we have the segregation in the same individual of the characters of
two distinct races of men. In other words, there has been segregation
of racial characters followed by their recombination in a hybrid
race. That is a fact of some importance, in what we may designate
as anthropological Eugenics, or, if we prefer it, as the Eugenics of
Anthropology. For it turns our thoughts to the possibility of calling
into being a more perfect type of men by the recombination of the
better alternative qualities of two less perfect races.</p>

<p>The second pedigree exhibited is that of "Family 4" in my
list. I am indebted to another informant for the facts of this
pedigree, and they relate to another part of North America. In this
case a Frenchman (Generation A, F) married a full-blood Indian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E64" id="Page_E64">[E64]</a></span>
Princess, namely, a daughter of a Chief. She had one only daughter
(Generation B, 2) whose nose was of the Indian type, but rather flat.</p>

<p>The daughter married an Irishman (Generation B, 1), and they
had six children. Of these three had European types of nose and
three the Indian type (Generation C, 1-6).</p>

<p>This family shows again an apparently clean segregation of
Indian and European types of nose. The two types appear, side by
side, in different individuals of the same fraternity.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE SEGREGATION OF RACIAL EYE-COLOUR.</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Geo. P. Mudge</span>.</p>

<p>It is a matter of importance to know the exact influence which
a mixture of races exerts upon the hereditary transmission of characters.
For instance, do the alternative characters of two races of
men, when they are related by marriage, segregate in inheritance in
accordance with Mendelian principles? Is the term "blending or
fusion of races misleading, and only accurate when employed in a
qualified sense"?</p>

<p>It has been shown by Mr. Hurst's very careful investigations in
a Leicestershire village that certain types of human eye-colour, which
he designates as "Simplex" and "Duplex," are inherited in complete
accord with Mendelian principles of inheritance. The two
types not only segregate from each other in the course of transmission,
but they do so in practically exact Mendelian proportions. And
the "Simplex" type, which is the recessive form of eye-colour, breeds
true. It begets nothing but the Simplex eye. These results have been
confirmed by Professor and Mrs. Davenport in America. In this
and similar cases we are merely dealing with the transmission of
alternative characters in individuals of the same race.<a name="FNanchor_D_7" id="FNanchor_D_7"></a>

a community of many commingled
races. But from our present standpoint that matters little. It is rather confirmatory
of the further facts and conclusions I am about to describe.</p>
</div>

<p>But one of the interesting problems of the future is concerned
with the transmission of characters when human races of diverse
characteristics breed together. We are not concerned to discuss now
whether the races of mankind are varieties or species.</p>

<p class="caption3">SPANIARD <i>v.</i> GIPSY.</p>

<p>The records of travellers provide certain information which helps
us to form reliable though limited conclusions as to the results of the
<span class="undrln">interbreeding of different human races</span>. Mrs. Rose Haig Thomas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E65" id="Page_E65">[E65]</a></span>
to whom we are indebted for the exhibit of a photograph, taken
during a journey through Spain a few years ago, of a Spanish gipsy
woman with her three children, has made several observations of
some interest. She became acquainted with a family in which "the
mother was a dark-skinned, black-haired, black-eyed gipsy woman.
(See photograph, Exhibit No. K 3.) The husband was a Spaniard
with blue eyes. There were three children. Of these, the eldest
had flaxen hair and blue eyes. The second was a boy with black
eyes, black hair, and an olive skin as dark as the mother's. The
third child was too young to justify any conclusion being based on
its characteristics. It was only 18 months old; but was flaxen-haired,
blue-eyed, and fair skinned." This observation of Mrs. Haig
Thomas, in Granada, affords then a clear example of the segregation
of blue-eye and flaxen-hair characters among the gametes of the
black-eyed, black-haired, and olive-complexioned mother. For, in
the light of Mendelian researches, it is obvious she was carrying these
characters recessive, and that some of her gametes were pure in
respect of them.</p>


<p class="caption3">ARAB <i>v.</i> SPANIARD.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="K_4"></a>K 4</div>

<p>The second photograph, exhibited by Mrs. Haig Thomas (Exhibit
No. K 4), is of three sisters who were also photographed in
Granada. The eldest is of the dark, typical "Arab type," so well
recognised by Spaniards wherever it is seen in Spain. The second
sister is clearly much lighter in hair and fairer in complexion than
her sister. The nose, too, is very distinct in both. The baby is
fair. It is impossible, of course, to trace the remote ancestry of
these sisters, and Mrs. Haig Thomas obtained no information as to
their parents, but from what we know of Spanish history the case
suggests a <span class="undrln">possible segregation of Moorish from Gothic features</span>
after the intermixture of the two races, by marriage, had occurred.
But the question is extremely complex. It is impossible to say to
what extent the inhabitants of modern Spain represent in varying
degrees a commingled race of Ph&#339;nicians and Iberians, of these with
Romans and Goths, and of all with Moors, themselves at the time of
the conquest of Spain a mixed race. All that can be said with any
degree of probability is that these various races have more or less
intermingled<a name="FNanchor_E_8" id="FNanchor_E_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_E_8" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> during the long

<p class="caption3">EUROPEAN <i>v.</i> AMERICAN RED INDIAN.</p>

<p>For the facts of the segregation of European and Indian
eye-colour, I am indebted to two friends who resided for many
years in different parts of Canada, and who do not desire their
names published.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="K_5"></a>K 5</div>

<p>The first case of this kind (Pedigree Chart, No. K 5) of <span class="undrln">segregation
of racial eye-colour</span> is that of the offspring from a marriage between
a blue-eyed Scotchman and a black-eyed, full blood American Red
Indian woman.<a name="FNanchor_F_9" id="FNanchor_F_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_F_9" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> They had a son and a daughter, and the eyes of both
were Indian brown. This brown differs from that of European eyes, and
can usually be distinguished by observers who know the two races
well. The half-breed son (No. 2, Generation B) married a full blood
Indian woman (No. 1), who also had Indian brown eyes, and by her
had four children. Two of them were babies at the time my informant
knew them, and we may leave them out of account. The
other two, a son and daughter (Nos. 2 and 1, Generation C), had
Indian brown eyes. This result is in accord with Mendelian
expectations.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_F_9" id="Footnote_F_9"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_F_9"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> This is the
same family as Family 5 described in connection with
Segregation of Nose Form in exhibit K 2a.</p>
</div>

<p>The half-breed Indian daughter (No. 4, Generation B) of the
blue-eyed Scotchman and Indian mother married a Welshman (No. 5,
B) with hazel eyes. They had seven children. Of these, two&mdash;a son
and daughter (No. 7 and 11, Generation C)&mdash;had blue eyes. The
remaining children&mdash;with the exception of a baby, whom my informant
had seldom seen&mdash;had eyes of varying shades of brown.
Two (Nos. 9 and 12, C) had European brown, one dark Indian
brown, and one Indian brown eyes (Nos. 8 and 10, C).</p>

<p>The re-appearance of blue eyes among two of the Scotchman's
grandchildren is a clear example of the Mendelian segregation among
the gametes of the half-breed Indian mother of the factors which
produce blue eyes. The Welsh father, with the hazel eyes, must,
of course, as we deduce from other cases, have carried the blue-eye
factors recessive.</p>

<p>The black-eyed full blood Indian grandmother also carried
various shades of Indian brown, recessive to the Indian black which
she herself manifested, since her daughter and two granddaughters
exhibited Indian brown and dark Indian brown coloured eyes. The
two European brown-eyed grandsons were probably in eye-colour
hybrids between the hazel colour of the Welsh father and the Indian
brown of the half-breed Indian mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E67" id="Page_E67">[E67]</a></span></p>

<p>The pedigree is thus, in respect of eye-colour&mdash;and of other
characters also which are not here described&mdash;clearly Mendelian in
its manifestations. It shows that the offspring of two very different
types of human races exhibit the same mode of Mendelian inheritance
as do the descendants of two contrasted parents of the same race.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="K_6"></a>K 6</div>

<p>Family 4 (Pedigree Chart, No. K 6) illustrates the same kind of
facts and conclusions. In the A Generation a Frenchman, whose eye-colour
was unknown to my informant, married a full blood Indian
princess who had Indian brown eyes. There was one daughter only
(Generation B) by this marriage, and she had Indian brown eyes. She
married an Irishman, who had red hair, grey eyes, and a freckled complexion
(Generation B). From this marriage there came six children
(Generation C). Two of these had "grey eyes like their father."
Three had dark brown eyes of European tint. My informant had
some doubt as to the European tint of two of these three (Nos. 3 and
4, C Generation); their eye-colour was very dark brown, and possibly
it may have been the Indian tint. The remaining member of this
generation had Indian brown eyes of a very dark shade.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to state that Families 4 and 5 come from
different parts of Canada.</p>

<p>The chief feature of interest in this family is the segregation
of the grey eye-colour of the Irishman among his offspring. It
appears in two daughters. From what we know of analogous cases,
there is little doubt that the gametes of his half-breed Indian wife
carried the blue or grey factors derived from her French father.
The appearance of an European brown eye-colour in Generation C,
No. 6, suggests that the French grandfather had brown eyes, and
that, therefore, this colour has segregated out among the gametes of
the half-breed Indian mother.</p>

<p>In the sweet pea the dark reddish purple axil is dominant to the

characters, the nature of the F_2 generation depends upon the way in
which the original cross was made. (A) When each parent has one

<p>The chart is 147 feet long, 54 inches wide, exclusive of the
important data condensed on a separate 8-foot sheet. This is only
a preliminary chart, as may be seen from the condensed data attached,
which shows that of the 822 persons represented on the chart 539 are
of mature age. The unknown persons represent 303, unknown
ability; 336, unknown height; 339, unknown weight; 348, unknown
health. The family is remarkable for the health of its members, having
so far only 97 deaths. The oldest child, Generation II-1, was born in
1827. There are, of course, a large number of persons on the chart
who are rather young. Where a person has more than one ability well
marked, such as music and literary ability, or music and business
ability, or constructive and business ability, the chart shows only one
ability. There are several cases where persons have three well marked
abilities. In all cases, the following is the rank on the chart:&mdash;</p>

<p>Literary ability is always charted. Following this, music and then
art, and then constructive. Constructive ability represents those
persons who have a decided mathematical and mechanical turn of
mind, who are builders, contractors, carpenters of advanced standing,
architects and men of these classes. Under "Various" abilities are
classified business, agricultural and domestic abilities. These are not
marked on the chart.</p>

<p>It will be noticed under "Diseases" that a majority of the
persons who have died were infants, and even among infants the deaths
are remarkable for their small number considering the conditions under
which the people of the third generation of this family had to live. The
paternal ancestor, Generation I., came to America in 1842, dying
two years later, and his children came to Utah among the early
settlers, 1847-52. Many of the third generation were born in this
State under conditions that are not by any means comparable to those
existing in communities that have been settled for many years. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E74" id="Page_E74">[E74]</a></span>
opportunity to care for children was very limited. Physicians were not
as easily reached, and the methods and appliances of modern times
were not at hand. Yet, even under these circumstances, it will be
noticed of the 822 persons listed on the chart, that only 68 deaths
were those of persons under 25 years.</p>

of Mental Capacities.</p>

<p class="center">1. "Experimental Tests of General Intelligence."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Q_1"></a>Q 1</div>

<p>A List of twelve tests applied to two schools at Oxford. The first
two columns of figures indicate the "reliability" or self-consistency
of the tests as compared with that of examinations and master's
general impression. The second two columns give the correlations of the
results of the tests with the children's "general intelligence." It will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E76" id="Page_E76">[E76]</a></span>
seen that several of the tests of higher mental processes are as reliable
as the scholastic tests at present in vogue, and that they correlate quite
as highly with intelligence. Further experiments show that while
examinations and master's estimates measure knowledge and skill
acquired by memory and training, the tests seems to provide measurements
rather of innate capacities; and that children of superior
parentage (<i>e.g.</i> the preparatory school boys) are themselves superior at
tests, which show an appreciable positive correlation with intelligence
(<i>i.e</i>. all except tests of touch and weight). The tests thus provide an
experimental demonstration of the inheritance of mental ability and a
means of measuring the same. (References:&mdash;Burt, Experimental
Tests of General Intelligence, British Journal of Psychology, Vol. III.,
Pts. 1 and 2.) Burt, Inheritance of Mental Characteristics, Eugenics
Review, 1912, July.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Q_2"></a>Q 2</div>

<p class="center">2. Sex-differences in mental tests.</p>

<p>A list of experimental tests applied to children of both sexes with
a view to measuring their innate capacities for performing mental processes
of different levels of complexity. The amount of divergence
between the sexes, is indicated by the column in red. It will be seen
that the sex-differences become smaller, the higher the level tested.
There is some evidence to show that these differences are the result of
inheritance and are not the result of difference of tradition or environment.

the sexes. Journal of Experimental Pedagogy, 1912, June. Burt,

<p>Four sets of questions drawn up by Dr. George Papillault, Professor
of Sociology in the Paris School of Anthropology, with a view to noting
and comparing the <span class="undrln">bio-social characteristics</span> of individuals belonging to
different groups of population.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="R_1"></a>R 1</div>

<p>Set of questions <span class="undrln">adopted by the Commission of Criminology</span>
instituted and presided over by Mr. &mdash;&mdash; Keeper of the Seals; Vice-presidents,
Messrs. Léon Bourgeois, senator, and Dr. Dron, Vice-president
of the Chamber of Deputies and Reporter to the Commission;
Scientific Secretary, Dr. G. Papillault.</p>

<p>This set of questions comprises:</p>

<p>1st. An individual criminological chart for the purpose of showing
271 biological and social characteristics of the prisoners.</p>

<p>2nd. Family Charts for each of the ancestors, descendants or
collateral relatives of the prisoner and more particularly intended to
note hereditary characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_E77" id="Page_E77">[E77]</a></span></p>

<p>These Charts have been issued with a view to a methodical
enquiry on the criminal, under the direction of the Scientific and
Criminological Department.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="R_2"></a>R 2</div>

<p>Set of questions of the French Lay Mission, designed to note the
characteristics of the young natives and of their relatives in the French
Colonies. The teachers will have to return them filled up with the
greatest care to the Lay Mission, where Dr. Papillault, before their
departure, delivered a series of lectures to teach them how to proceed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="R_3"></a>R 3</div>

<p>Questions on the half-breeds, adopted by the Paris Society of
Anthropology, and designed to show the bio-social characteristics of the
half-breeds proceeding from cross-breeding between different races.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="R_4"></a>R 4</div>

<p>Questions asked by the General Psychological Institute for the
purpose of undertaking a vast enquiry on the value taxonomic, organic,
bio-social, and selective of the different human races which actually
exist in the French Colonies, and particularly in North Africa.</p>

<p>A like spirit and method governs these four sets of questions; to
discard the verbalism which obstructs and imperils Sociology; to study
characteristics precise, objective, easily controllable and comparable, and
likely consequently to form statistics, which alone, are capable of
revealing characteristics of groups; to establish the correlations which
these characteristics may present among themselves, and to arrive at last
at the discovery of positive sociological laws.</p>

<p>Thirteen photographic copies of authentic portraits of distinguished
historical personages of the sixteenth century, showing that the

<p>Jane Seymour (Holbein). Eyes far apart, upper eye lids characteristic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="S_7"></a>S 7</div>

<p>Jean de Bourbon, Comte d'Enghien. XVI Century. Eyes far
apart, upper eye-lids vertically prominent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="S_8"></a>S 8</div>

<p>Portrait of a young German gentleman.</p>

<p>The eye-lids are modern, that is the eyes are set in deeply under
the arch, but the eyes themselves are far apart, and the upper part of
the nose is broad.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="S_9"></a>S 9</div>

<p>Mary Queen of England. (National Portrait Gallery).</p>

<p>It would seem that allowance might be made for the crudity of the
portrait, but the naso-orbital region is typical of the northern races
during the XVI century.</p>

<p>Holbein's Duke of Norfolk. In the Royal Gallery at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>Eyes are more deep-set under the superorbital arch than is usual in

are far apart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><a name="S_11"></a>S 11</div>

<p>Henry VIII., attributed to Holbein but on doubtful authority.</p>

<p>Broad flat nose, small eyes set far apart, eye-brows arching upward

<p>Portrait of the Prothonotary Apostolic Juliano. (Lorenzo Lotto.)</p>

<p>Modern type of face. Eyes deep set in under the superorbital arch and

of face is occasionally, but only rarely met with north of the Alps
during the early period. It is common enough in portraits of Italians.</p>

<p class="caption2">First International Eugenics Congress</p>

<p class="caption3">LONDON.</p>

<p class="caption3">Wednesday, July 24th, to Tuesday, July 30th, 1912.</p>



<p><b>General Arrangements for the Meeting.</b></p>

<p>An invitation circular has been widely circulated to all members of
Eugenic and Heredity Societies in Europe and America, and to many other
persons likely to be interested in the approaching Congress. Through that
circular the objects and general plan of the Congress have been made widely
known. Copies may still be had on application to the Secretary.</p>

<p>The following arrangements have now been definitely made.</p>

<p><b>Place of Meeting.</b> The Meetings of the Congress will be held in
the Great Hall of the University of London, Imperial Institute Road,
South Kensington, London, S.W., which is easily reached from South
Kensington Station on the Underground Railway, and by omnibus from all
parts of London. (In wet weather those travelling by rail can avail themselves
of the subway).</p>

<p><b>Headquarters of the Congress.</b> Until Tuesday, July 23rd, the
headquarters and offices of the Congress will remain at 6, York Buildings,
Adelphi, W.C. (close to Charing Cross Station), where all information will
be supplied and tickets issued. Office hours 10-30 a.m. to 5 p.m. On and
after Wednesday, July 24th, the headquarters will be transferred to the
University of London, South Kensington. If arrangements for hotels or for
lodgings have not been made previously, members arriving on and after
July 24th are recommended to leave their luggage in the "Cloak Room" at
the railway station and come to the office of the Congress, at London
University, South Kensington, for information.</p>

<p><b>Correspondence.</b> From July 24th to 30th, Members and Associates
of the Congress may have their letters addressed to them at the First
International Eugenics Congress, c/o The University of London, South
Kensington, S.W., where special postal facilities will be provided. All
invitations to Receptions, etc., will be distributed in this way.</p>

<p><b>Languages.</b> It has been decided that in the Meetings and Discussions
the English, French, German, and Italian languages shall be on an equal
footing. At the same time it is right to point out that in all Congresses the
number of Members speaking and understanding only the language of the
country in which they are held has been far in excess of those conversant
with several languages; therefore those who speak in English on the present
occasion will be most widely understood. The abstract of every paper which
is received in time by the Secretary will be translated into English, French,
and German. Pamphlets containing the abstracts in these languages will
be available on July 24th at the University Buildings. Members wishing

official Congress ticket must be produced when paying the fare.
The subscription entitling to membership of the Congress is £1 sterling;
for an Associate it is 10/-. Members may obtain additional tickets for ladies
at the cost of 10/- each. These additional ladies' tickets are transferable to
ladies. Associates are entitled to all the privileges of Members, except that
they have no vote in the meetings and will not receive a copy of the Report
when published. The tickets of all Members and Associates who pay in
advance will be forwarded to their addresses before the commencement of
the Congress. A limited number of Day Membership Cards at 5/- each will

will be followed by a Reception to which all Members and Associates of the
Congress will be invited.</p>

<p><b>Railway Arrangements.</b> Important concessions have been made
by a number of Railway Companies to Members and Associates of the Congress.
On the railways of Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Switzerland and
Holland, no reductions will be allowed; but by taking tickets to a station in
Belgium or France, near the frontier, reductions may be secured by groups of
not less than 20 visitors travelling together from those countries for the rest

Membership Ticket before receiving railway tickets at reduced rates; and
arrangements MUST be made in advance, 14 days' notice being required.
Persons desiring to take advantage of these concessions must therefore
forward their subscriptions at once; and immediately on receipt of

Congress voucher at the Booking Office.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="blockquot">Members wishing to return to their homes outside London daily, must
apply for separate vouchers for each day if the distance is more than 50
miles. If however the member resides within that distance, the usual
sleeping-out arrangements will apply, <i>i.e.</i>, that tickets at a single fare and a
third for the double journey may be issued (upon production of cards of
membership or letters of invitation), <span class="smcap">from</span> the town where the Conference is
being held to places where the delegates reside. The minimum fare will

<p><b>Hospitality Bureau.</b> During the meeting of the Congress there will
be many entertainments in the form of receptions, dinners, afternoon and
evening parties, for which there will be invitations to Members and
Associates of the Congress. In most cases the number to be entertained is
limited, and it is desirable that the Secretaries should have as complete a
list of members as possible to submit to the hosts.</p>

<p>All <b>Officials of the Congress</b>, and <b>Readers of Papers</b>, and <b>Delegates</b>,
will shortly receive invitations to the various entertainments mentioned in the
programme.</p>

<p><i>Members should apply at the Hospitality Bureau in the Marble Hall on

<p class="caption2"><a name="RULES_OF_PROCEDURE" id="RULES_OF_PROCEDURE">RULES OF PROCEDURE.</a></p>


<p>The Organising Committee feel that the interest and usefulness of the
Congress will be greatly increased by the usual sectional plan being
departed from, so that all papers can be discussed in general sittings. This
plan will necessarily limit the time available for papers, but, on the other
hand, it will allow the interest of all members to be focused on each question
to be considered. To enable the maximum amount of work to be done in
the time available, the following arrangements have been made:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Papers.</b> The reader of each paper will be allowed 25 minutes in
which to give a summary of his paper and to reply to criticisms. A certain
time, limited at the discretion of the Chairman, will then be allowed for
discussion (maximum time&mdash;20 minutes).</p>

<p>Should the reader of a paper not desire to exercise his right of reply he
may devote the whole 25 minutes to his opening summary.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, he prefers to reserve a longer time for reply he
must reduce the length of his opening remarks, bearing in mind that the
whole time at his disposal for the two speeches will be 25 minutes.</p>

<p><b>Discussions.</b> All discussions are under the absolute control of the
Chairman, who will regulate the length of time allotted to each discussion,
and to each speaker in that discussion. The Chairman will ring a bell one
minute before each speech must end. After the bell is rung a second time
the next speaker will be called. The maximum time allotted to the
discussion on each single paper is twenty minutes,&mdash;to each single
speaker, seven minutes.</p>

<p>The names of persons wishing to speak must be handed up to the
Chairman before the conclusion of the speech opening the Discussion.</p>

<p><b>Badges.</b> A button badge, consisting of a reproduction of the head
of Sir Francis Galton, will be presented to every Member and Associate.</p>

<p>A silvered medal with ribbon and clasp will be presented to members of
the Consultative Committees, Readers of Papers and Government Delegates.
Distinctive colours will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Medal Colours">
<tr>
  <td class="tdl"><i>Organizing and Consultative Committees</i></td>
